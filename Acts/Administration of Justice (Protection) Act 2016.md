TYPES OF CONTEMPT

### Contempt by scandalising court, interfering with administration of justice, etc.

3\.—(1) Any person who —

(a) scandalises the court by intentionally publishing any matter or doing any act that —

(i) imputes improper motives to or impugns the integrity, propriety or impartiality of any court; and

(ii) poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined;

(b) intentionally publishes any matter that —

(i) prejudges an issue in a court proceeding that is pending and such prejudgment prejudices, interferes with, or poses a real risk of prejudice to or interference with, the course of any court proceeding that is pending; or

(ii) otherwise prejudices, interferes with, or poses a real risk of prejudice to or interference with, the course of any court proceeding that is pending;

(d) intentionally offers any insult or causes any interruption or obstruction to any judge of any court, while such judge is sitting in any stage of a court proceeding; or

(e) intentionally does any other act that interferes with, obstructs or poses a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice in any other manner, if the person knows or ought to have known that the act would interfere with, obstruct or pose a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice,

commits a contempt of court.

Explanation1.—Fair criticism of a court is not contempt by scandalising the court within the meaning of subsection (1)(a).

Explanation2.—A publication of any matter which falls within subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii) is not incapable of prejudicing or interfering with or posing a real risk of prejudice to or interference with, the course of any pending court proceedings, by reason only that the court is presided by a judge with legal and professional experience.

Illustration 1

Ais charged for rape ofB.Zpublishes in a newspaper an interview withA’s ex‑girlfriend,Y. In the interview,Yclaims thatAhad previously brutally raped her and thatAhad served a long prison sentence for raping and molesting other women. The prosecution is not permitted to discloseA’s previous convictions duringA’s pending rape trial.Z’s publication of this interview poses a real risk of prejudice to or interference with the course of pending court proceedings againstA.

Illustration 2

Ais charged for inflicting serious bodily harm onBoutside a pub. As it was dark,Bhad difficulty recognisingB’s assailant.Zposts on an Internet news site, a photo ofAwith fists clenched outside the pub with the caption, “Vicious Pub Bully Caught”. The identity ofB’s assailant is an issue inA’s pending trial.Z’s publication ofA’s photo and caption poses a real risk of prejudice to or interference with the course of the pending court proceedings againstA.

(2) Where any person publishes any matter or does any act referred to in subsection (1)(a), that person is guilty of contempt of court even if he or she did not intend to scandalise the court.

(3) Where any person publishes any matter referred to in subsection (1)(b), that person is guilty of contempt of court even if he or she did not intend to cause the consequences referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii).

(4) A statement made by a person on behalf of the Government about the subject matter of or an issue in a court proceeding that is pending is not contempt of court under subsection (1)(b) if the Government believes that such statement is necessary in the public interest.

Illustration 1

A statement made by a person on behalf of the Government factually describing the events and circumstances relating to and leading up to the death of a person (such as the acts of public officials when a coroner’s inquiry into that person’s death is pending) which the Government believes is necessary to address inaccurate or incorrect public allegations, is not contempt of court by virtue of subsection (4).

Illustration 2

A statement made by a person on behalf of the Government factually describing the circumstances of a riot, when criminal proceedings against a person charged with participation in that riot are pending, which the Government believes is necessary in order to inform the public of the riot, is not contempt of court by virtue of subsection (4).

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), “necessary in the public interest” includes but is not limited to matters that are necessary in the interests of the security of Singapore or any part of Singapore, public order, public health or public finances.

(6) Where contempt of court is committed by the doing of any act mentioned in subsection (1)(c) or (d), a person is guilty of contempt of court if that person knows or ought to have known that the act would prejudice or interfere with or obstruct or pose a real risk of prejudice to or interference with or obstruction of the course of the court proceeding.

### Contempt by disobedience of court order or undertaking, etc.

4\.—(1) Any person who —

(a) intentionally disobeys or breaches any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court; or

(b) intentionally breaches any undertaking given to a court,

commits a contempt of court.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), intentional disposal by a garnishee, otherwise than in accordance with law or by leave of the court, of any property attached in his or her hands or under his or her control, is contempt of court.

(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person commits a contempt of court if the person —

(a) being legally bound to produce or deliver any document to the court, intentionally omits to so produce or deliver up the document;

(b) being legally bound to bind himself or herself by oath or affirmation to state the truth, refuses to so bind himself or herself;

(c) being legally bound to state the truth on any subject to the court, refuses to answer any question demanded of him or her touching that subject by the court in the exercise of the lawful powers of the court; or

(d) refuses to sign any statement made by him or her, when required to sign that statement by a court lawfully competent to require that he or she sign that statement.

(4) Subject to subsections (5), (6) and (7), any contempt of court referred to in subsection (1) or (2) may be waived by the aggrieved party and such waiver relieves from liability the person who commits the contempt.

(5) The court may, in its discretion, disallow the waiver of any contempt of court mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) in any of the following circumstances:

(a) the Attorney-General has authorised investigations pursuant to section 22 for the contempt of court;

(b) proceedings have been commenced in respect of the contempt of court;

(c) the contempt of court is of such a nature that it interferes with, obstructs or poses a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice;

(d) it would be contrary to the public interest to allow the waiver.

(6) The court may, in granting any waiver of contempt of court under subsection (4), impose such conditions as it thinks fit.

(7) To avoid doubt, contempt of court referred to in subsection (3) may not be waived.

(8) A person who is not a party to an action commits contempt if he or she causes or abets the breach of any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court, with the intention of causing such breach or knowing that it would cause such breach.

(9) In this section —

“aggrieved party” means a party to the relevant proceedings for whose benefit any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court is given, made or issued, or any undertaking to a court is given, in proceedings other than a proceeding against a person in respect of any offence;

“undertaking given to a court” includes an implied undertaking given to a court.

### Contempt by unauthorised audio or visual recordings

5\.—(1) Subject to subsection (4), it is a contempt of court —

(b) to publish or transmit an audio or a visual recording or both of court proceedings made by means of any such audio recorder, electronic device or other instrument, or any recording derived directly or indirectly from it; or

(c) to use any such recording in contravention of any conditions of leave granted under paragraph (a).

(2) Leave under subsection (1)(a) may be granted or refused at the discretion of the court, and if granted may be granted subject to such conditions as the court thinks proper with respect to the use of any recording made pursuant to the leave; and where leave has been granted, the court may at its discretion withdraw or amend it either generally or in relation to any particular part of the proceedings.

(3) Without prejudice to any other power to deal with an act under subsection (1)(a), the court may order the audio recorder, electronic device or other instrument, or any recording made with it, or both, to be forfeited; and any object so forfeited must (unless the court otherwise determines on application by a person appearing to be the owner) be sold or otherwise disposed of in such manner as the court may direct.

(3) A person mentioned in subsection (2) may rely on a defence that would be available to the unincorporated association or partnership if it were charged with the contempt of court with which the person is charged and, in doing so, the person bears the same burden of proof that the unincorporated association or partnership would bear.

APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE

22\.—(1) Where the Attorney-General —

(a) receives a complaint from a judge that contempt of court has been committed; or

(b) has reasonable grounds to otherwise suspect that contempt of court has been committed and that it is in the public interest to do so,

the Attorney‑General must, in the case of a complaint made under paragraph (a) in relation to contempt of court under section 3 or 4(8), and may, in any other case, by order in writing authorise a police officer to investigate the alleged contempt as if it were an arrestable offence in such manner or mode as may be specified in that order.

### Application of Criminal Procedure Code

## PART 6

PROCEDURAL MATTERS

### Summary procedure where contempt is in face of court

25\.—(1) Where it appears to a court (other than a Small Claims Tribunal and an Employment Claims Tribunal), that a person has committed contempt in the face of the court, and that court is satisfied that it is necessary for immediate steps to be taken for the protection of the due administration of justice, that court may cause such person to be detained in custody, and must as soon as practicable —

(a) cause the person to be informed in writing of the contempt with which he or she is charged;

(b) afford the person an opportunity to make his or her defence to the charge;

(c) after taking such evidence as may be necessary or as may be offered by the person and after hearing the person, proceed, either immediately or after adjournment, to determine the matter of the charge; and

(d) make such order for the punishment or discharge of the person as may be just.

(2) Despite subsection (3), the court may direct that a person charged with contempt in the face of the court be detained in such custody as the court may specify pending the determination of the charge or be released on bail or on his or her own bond.

(3) The provisions under Division 5 of Part VI of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) apply to any case where the court releases the person charged with a contempt of court on bail or on his or her own bond under this section and for the purposes of those provisions, the contempt of court is treated as a non‑bailable offence.

(4) To avoid doubt and despite subsections (1) and (2), the proceedings being conducted in the court before the contempt in the face of the court was committed may continue as the court thinks fit.

### Contempt proceedings

26\.—(1) Proceedings for contempt of court and the power of the court to punish the contempt of court must be exercised in accordance with the procedure set out in Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules.

(2) To avoid doubt, this section applies to proceedings for contempt of court even though —

(a) the Attorney-General has under section 22 authorised a police officer to investigate an alleged contempt as if it were an arrestable offence;

(b) the Attorney-General has under section 23 authorised a police officer to exercise all or any of the powers in relation to police investigations set out in Part 1 of the Schedule; or

(c) the Attorney-General’s consent is required under section 30 for the institution of such proceedings for contempt of court.

(3) The court in any proceedings for contempt of court may award costs to be paid by or to any party as it thinks fit.

(6) To avoid doubt and for the purposes of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and the State Courts Act (Cap. 321), any originating process for contempt of court is an originating process for the purposes of service outside Singapore in the circumstances authorised by and in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules.

### Bail in contempt proceedings

27\.—(1) When any person appears before a court in proceedings for contempt of court, the person may be released on bail by that court.

(2) Instead of taking bail from the person, the court may release the person if he or she signs a personal bond without sureties.

(3) The provisions under Division 5 of Part VI of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) apply to any case where the court releases the person charged with a contempt of court on bail or on his or her own bond under this section and for the purposes of those provisions, the contempt of court is treated as a non‑bailable offence.

(4) A court may grant bail to a person who has filed an appeal against any order or decision in accordance with section 32.

### Standard of proof for contempt of court

28\. The standard of proof for establishing contempt of court is that of beyond reasonable doubt.

### Burden and standard of proof for defences

29\. To avoid doubt, the burden of proof for proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the defences to contempt of court under Part 4 is upon the person relying on the defence and the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities.

### Consent of Attorney-General

30\.—(1) No proceedings for contempt of court as defined in section 3 or 4(8) may be instituted except by or with the consent of the Attorney‑General.

(2) To avoid doubt, proceedings for contempt in the face of the court under section 25 and any other proceedings commenced by the High Court or the Court of Appeal on its own motion do not require the consent of the Attorney‑General.

### Attorney-General’s power to take over conduct of proceedings, etc.

31\. Where proceedings for contempt of court, that were not commenced by a court, are conducted by a person other than the Attorney‑General, the Attorney‑General may, if he or she thinks fit, take over the conduct of the proceedings at any stage of the proceedings and continue the proceedings or, with the consent of the court, discontinue the proceedings.

### Appeals

32\.—(1) An appeal lies from any order or decision of the High Court, a State Court, a Family Court or a Youth Court —

(a) in the exercise of its jurisdiction to try and punish for contempt of court; or

(b) otherwise under this Act.

(2) In addition to the cases in section 34(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322), no appeal under subsection (1) against any order or decision of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction can be brought to the Court of Appeal except with the leave of the High Court or the Court of Appeal.

(3) The appeal or application for leave to appeal must be filed in accordance with Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules, as the case may be, as if the appeal were an appeal in civil proceedings.

(4) An appeal does not operate as a stay of execution unless the trial court or the appellate court so orders.

(5) The trial court or the appellate court may stay execution on any judgment, order or punishment pending appeal on such terms as to security for the payment of any money or the performance or non‑performance of any act or the suffering of any punishment ordered by or in such judgment or order as to the court may seem reasonable.

(6) At the hearing of the appeal, the appellate court has and may exercise any power which the trial court may have exercised.

### Enforcement of fines

33\. Payment of a fine for contempt of court imposed by any court may be enforced upon the order of the court in like manner as a fine imposed by a court in criminal proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68).
