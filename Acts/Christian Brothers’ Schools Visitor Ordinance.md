And Whereas the present holder of the office of “Visitor in the Straits Settlements of the Christian Brothers’ Schools” is the Reverend James Joseph Byrne, generally known as Brother James, who was appointed by an instrument under the hand and seal of the Superior General of the Society of Christian Brothers known in French as the Institut des Frères des Ecoles Chrètiennes and it is expedient for the better carrying on of the financial business of the said Institution that the said James Joseph Byrne as such Visitor as aforesaid and his successors in that office should be incorporated:

It is hereby enacted by the Governor of the Straits Settlements with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council thereof as follows:

(2) The said seal may from time to time be broken, changed, altered and made anew as to the corporation seems fit.

(3) The corporation may acquire, purchase, take, hold and enjoy movable and immovable property of every description and may sell, convey, assign, surrender and yield up, mortgage, demise, reassign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any movable or immovable property vested in the corporation upon such terms as to the corporation seems fit.

(4) No person shall be deemed to be duly qualified as aforesaid unless and until he has first, with the approval of the Minister signified under his hand and seal, caused the power of attorney or other instrument constituting him such Visitor to be duly filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court at Singapore, pursuant to section 48 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Ordinance [1955 Ed., Cap. 243], and unless and until a notification of such filing has appeared in theGazette.

### Use of the corporate seal

3\.—(1) No deed, document or other instrument sealed with the seal of the corporation shall be deemed to be duly sealed unless such seal has been affixed in the presence of the said James Joseph Byrne or his attorney duly authorized by a power of attorney registered under section 48 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Ordinance [1955 Ed., Cap. 243], or in the presence of his successor for the time being in his said office of Visitor and duly qualified as aforesaid, and unless such deed, document or other instrument is signed by the said James Joseph Byrne or his attorney or by his successor or his said attorney.
