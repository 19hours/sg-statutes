(a) the articles, non‑physical products, or sets of articles and non‑physical products, to which any of those designs is intended to be applied, as specified in the application, fall within the same class, or (if they fall within more than one class) all of the same classes, under the classification mentioned in section 75(1)(c), as the articles, non‑physical products, or sets of articles and non‑physical products, to which each of the other designs is intended to be applied, as specified in the application; and

(b) the application complies with such other requirements as may be prescribed.

[Act 29 of 2017 wef 30/10/2017]

### Claim to priority of Convention application

12\.—(1) Subject to subsection (7), where —

(a) a person has filed an application for the registration of a design in a Convention country in respect of certain articles or non‑physical products;

[Act 29 of 2017 wef 30/10/2017]

(b) that application is the first application for the registration of the design to be filed in any Convention country in respect of those articles or non‑physical products (referred to in this section as the first Convention application); and

[Act 29 of 2017 wef 30/10/2017]

(c) within 6 months after the date on which the first Convention application is filed, that person or his successor in title applies under this Act for the registration of the design in respect of all or any of those articles or non‑physical products,

[Act 29 of 2017 wef 30/10/2017]

that person or his successor in title may, when filing the application under this Act, claim a right of priority for the registration of the design in respect of all or any of the articles or non‑physical products for which registration was sought in the first Convention application.

[44/2004]

[Act 29 of 2017 wef 30/10/2017]

(2) Where any person claims a right of priority in accordance with subsection (1) in respect of an application for the registration of a design —

(a) the person shall have priority from (and including) the date on which the first Convention application was filed; and

(b) the application shall be treated, for the purposes of determining whether that or any other design is new, as filed on the date on which the first Convention application was filed.

[44/2004]

(3) Subsection (2) shall not be construed as excluding the power to give directions under section 5(3) in relation to the application for the registration of a design.

[44/2004]

(4) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Act, where a right of priority is claimed in respect of an application for the registration of a design, the application shall not be refused, and the registration of the design under this Act shall not be revoked, by reason only of the fact that the first Convention application has been published during the period between —

(a) the date the first Convention application was filed; and

(b) the date the application under this Act was filed.

[44/2004]

(5) Any filing of an application for the registration of a design which in a Convention country is equivalent to a regular national filing, under its domestic legislation or an international agreement, shall be treated as giving rise to the right of priority.

[44/2004]

(6) In subsection (5), “regular national filing” means a filing which is adequate to establish the date on which the application was filed in the Convention country, whatever may be the outcome of the application.

[44/2004]

(7) Where a subsequent application for registration of a design concerning the same subject as an earlier application is filed, whether in the same or a different Convention country, and these are the first 2 applications concerning that subject to be filed in any Convention country, the subsequent application shall be considered the first Convention application if, at the date the subsequent application is filed —

(a) the earlier application has been withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without having been laid open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding; and

(b) the earlier application has not yet served as a basis for claiming a right of priority.

[44/2004]

(8) For the avoidance of doubt, where subsection (7) applies —

(a) the date on which the subsequent application was filed, rather than that of the earlier application, shall be considered the starting date of the period of priority under subsection (2); and

(b) the earlier application may not thereafter serve as a basis for claiming a right of priority.

[44/2004]

(9) The Minister may make rules as to the manner of claiming priority under this section.

[44/2004]

(10) A right to priority arising under this section may be assigned or otherwise transmitted, either with the application or independently, and the reference in subsection (1) to the applicant’s “successor in title” shall be construed accordingly.

(a) the application is derived under section 11(5) from an application filed under section 11(1) for the registration of 2 or more designs; and

(b) the amendment would result in the articles, non‑physical products, or sets of articles and non‑physical products, to which any of those designs is intended to be applied, and the articles, non‑physical products, or sets of articles and non‑physical products, to which another of those designs is intended to be applied, falling within different classes.

23\.—(1) After a design is registered, any person having or claiming an interest in the design may apply to the Court to determine —

(a) who is the true owner of the design;

(b) whether the design should have been registered in the name of the person in whose name it was registered; or

(c) whether any right in the design should be transferred or granted to any other person,

and the Court shall determine the question and may make such order as it considers appropriate to give effect to the determination.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), an order referred to in that subsection may contain one or more of the following directions:

(a) that the name of the applicant be entered in the Register as the owner or one of the owners of the design (whether or not to the exclusion of any other person);

(b) that the transaction by virtue of which that person has acquired any right in the design be registered;

(c) that a licence for the use of the design be granted; and

(2) Where an order is so made that a registered design shall be transferred from the old owner or owners to one or more persons none of whom was an old owner (on the ground that the design was registered in the name of a person not entitled to be registered as an owner), any licences or other rights in the design shall, subject to the provisions of the order and subsection (3), lapse on the registration of that person or those persons as the new owner or owners of the design.

(3) Where an order referred to in subsection (2) is made and, before particulars of the reference resulting in the making of the order are entered in the Register, the old owner or owners or a licensee —

(b) made in good faith effective and serious preparations to carry out such an act,

the old owner or owners or the licensee shall, on making a request to the new owner or owners within the prescribed period, be entitled to be granted a licence (but not an exclusive licence) to continue to do the act or, as the case may be, to do the act.

(4) A licence under subsection (3) shall be for a reasonable period and subject to reasonable terms.

(5) The new owner or owners of the registered design or any person claiming that he is entitled to be granted a licence under subsection (3) may apply to the Court for a determination of whether —
