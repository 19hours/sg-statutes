(2) A member of a society shall not, without his consent in writing having been first obtained, be bound by any amendment of the society’s by-laws registered after he became a member, if and so far as that amendment requires him to take or to subscribe for more shares than the number held by him at the date of registration of the amendment, or to pay upon the shares so held any sum exceeding the amount unpaid upon them at that date, or in any other way increases the liability of that member to contribute to the share, subscription or loan capital of the society.

### Contracts with members

21\.—(1) A society which has as one of its objects the disposal of any article produced or obtained by the work or industry of its members, whether the produce of handicraft, agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries or otherwise, may provide in its by-laws or may otherwise contract with its members —

(a) that every such member who produces any such article shall dispose of the whole or any specified amount, proportion or description thereof to or through the society; and

(b) that a member who is proved or adjudged, in accordance with the provisions of this Act and in such manner as may be prescribed by the by-laws, to be guilty of a breach of the by-laws or contract shall pay to the society as liquidated damages a sum ascertained or assessed in such manner as may be prescribed by the by-laws.

(2) The validity of a by-law made by a society or a contract entered into under this section shall not be affected by reason only that it constitutes a contract in restraint of trade.

### Imposition of fines upon members

22\.—(1) The by-laws may provide for the imposition of fines on its members for any infringement of its by-laws, but no such fine shall be imposed upon any member until a written notice of the intention to impose the fine and the reason therefor has been served on him and he has had an opportunity of being heard or otherwise showing cause why the fine should not be imposed.

(2) No fine exceeding $50 shall be imposed except with the written approval of the Registrar.

(3) Any such fine shall be recoverable by the society as a debt due to the society.

### Creation of charges in favour of societies

(a) supplied to a member or past member industrial implements or machinery or materials for manufacture or building, or seeds, fertiliser, animals, feeding stuffs or agricultural implements;

(b) rendered services to a member or past member; or

(c) lent money to a member or past member to enable him to buy those things or to obtain those services,

the society shall have a first charge upon those things or, as the case may be, upon industrial or agricultural produce, animals or articles produced therewith or therefrom or with the aid of the money, except that nothing herein contained shall affect the claim of a bona fide purchaser or transferee without notice.

(2) Outstanding demands or dues payable to a housing society by a member or past member in respect of rent, shares, loans or purchase money or any other rights or amounts payable to the society shall be a first charge upon his interest in the immovable property of the society.

### Charge and set-off in respect of shares or interest of members

24\. A society shall have a charge upon the share or interest in the capital and on the deposits of a member or past member or deceased member and upon a dividend or patronage refund payable to a member or past member or to the estate of a deceased member in respect of a debt due to the society from the member or past member or estate, and may set off a sum credited or payable to a member or past member or estate of a deceased member for the payment of any such debt.

### Shares or interest not liable to attachment or sale

25\. Subject to section 24, the share or interest of a member in the capital of a society shall not be liable to attachment or sale under any decree or order of a court in respect of a debt or liability incurred by the member, and neither his assignee in insolvency nor a receiver duly appointed shall be entitled to, or have a claim on, that share or interest.

### Transfer of shares or interest on death or permanent insanity of a member

26\.—(1) On the death of a member, a society may transfer the share or interest of the deceased member —

(a) to the person nominated by the member in accordance with section 45;

(b) if there is no person so nominated, to such person as may appear to the committee of management of the society to be the legal personal representative of the deceased member; or

(c) if either of those persons referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) is not qualified under this Act or under the by-laws of the society for membership, to such other person who is so qualified, to be specified within 6 months after the death of the deceased member by the nominee or legal personal representative, as the case may be.

(2) A society may pay all other moneys due to the deceased member from the society to such nominee or legal personal representative, as the case may be.

(3) Where a member or person claiming through a member of a society is insane, and no committee of his estate or trustee of his property has been duly appointed, the society may, when it is proved to the satisfaction of the committee of management that it is just and expedient to do so, pay or transfer the share or interest of the member or the value of all other moneys due to the member from the society to a person whom they shall judge proper to receive the same on his behalf.

(4) The value of the share or interest of the deceased member or of the insane member or person claiming through a member shall be represented by the sum actually paid by the member to acquire the share or interest unless the by-laws provide the calculation thereof otherwise.

(5) All transfers and payments made by a society in accordance with this section shall be valid and effectual against a demand made upon the society by another person.

### Deposits by or on behalf of minors

27\.—(1) A society may receive deposits from or for the benefit of minors and it shall be lawful for a society to pay them the interest which may become due on the deposits. A deposit made by a minor may, together with the interest accrued thereon, be paid to that minor; and a deposit made on behalf of a minor may, together with the interest accrued thereon, be paid to the guardian of that minor for the use of the minor.

(2) The receipt of a minor or guardian for money paid to him under this section shall be a sufficient discharge of the liability of the society in respect of that money.

### Contracts with members of society who are minors

28\. The minority of a person duly admitted as a member of any society shall not preclude that person from executing any instrument or giving a discharge necessary to be given under this Act or the Rules, and shall not be a ground for invalidating or avoiding a contract entered into by any such person with the society, and the contract entered into by that person with the society, whether as principal or as surety, shall be enforceable at law or against that person notwithstanding his minority, except that this section shall not apply to school co-operatives.

### Proof of entries in the books of society

29\.—(1) A copy of an entry in a book of a society, regularly kept in the course of business, shall be prima facie evidence in any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, of the existence of the entry and of the matters, transactions and accounts therein recorded in every case where, and to the same extent as, the original entry itself is admissible.

(2) Such copy of an entry in the book of a society shall be certified by a written certificate at the foot of the copy, declaring that it is a true copy of the entry and that the book containing the entry is still in the custody of the society, the certificate being dated and signed by the chairman and the secretary of the society.

(3) No officer of any such society shall, in any legal proceedings to which the society or the liquidator of the society is not a party, be compelled to produce any of the society’s books, the contents of which can be proved under subsection (1) or to appear as witness to prove matters, transactions or accounts therein recorded, unless the court for special reasons so directs.

### Government assistance
