(2) In deciding whether to make an order under subsection (1) in respect of any area, the Minister may have regard to any one or more of the following:

(a) incidents of any crime in or near the area, whether or not these incidents are related to liquor consumption;

(b) information about the consumption of liquor in or near the area (including the amount and type of liquor supplied under each liquor licence in or near the area and the restrictions and conditions of the liquor licence);

(3) Once an order under subsection (1) is made, the Minister must, within 7 days after the publication of the order in theGazetteand before the date the order comes into force, cause to be published a notice of the Liquor Control Zone referred to in the order in such manner as will secure adequate publicity for the Liquor Control Zone.

(2) A person who fails to comply with a requirement referred to in subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000.

(3) To avoid doubt, this section is to have effect despite any other written law authorising the carrying on of business activities at the premises specified in the order under subsection (1).

Division 2 —

Liquor Control Zone banning notice

### Liquor Control Zone banning notice

18\.—(1) The Commissioner or an authorised officer may give a Liquor Control Zone banning notice to an individual banning the individual, for a period specified in the notice, from one or more Liquor Control Zones or from all licensed premises in any Liquor Control Zone, if the Commissioner or authorised officer suspects, on reasonable grounds, the individual of committing or having committed an offence under section 12 or 14 wholly or partly in a Liquor Control Zone.

(2) In determining whether a Liquor Control Zone banning notice for any Liquor Control Zone should be given under this section to an individual, the Commissioner or authorised officer is to have regard to each of the following:

(a) whether the individual is likely to commit another offence under section 12 or 14 in the same or a different Liquor Control Zone;

(b) whether the Liquor Control Zone banning notice, if so given, would be an effective and reasonable way of preventing the individual from committing another offence under section 12 or 14 in the same or a different Liquor Control Zone;

(c) whether the commission of another offence under section 12 or 14 in the same or a different Liquor Control Zone by the individual may involve or give rise to a risk of riot, civil disturbance or any other violence in the Liquor Control Zone to which the banning notice is to relate.

(3) If the Commissioner or authorised officer intends to give a Liquor Control Zone banning notice to an individual, the Commissioner or authorised officer does not need to first give the individual an opportunity to be heard.

(d) whether the notice is absolute or with exceptions and if it is with exceptions, the details of the conditions or circumstances under which the individual may enter or remain in the Liquor Control Zone.
