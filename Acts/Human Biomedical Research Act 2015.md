(e) the donation of the tissue is voluntary and the renunciation of the donor’s rights to the tissue and any intellectual property rights that may be derived from the use of the tissue;

(f) the donor’s right to withdraw his or her consent in the circumstances specified in section 14 and the limitations of such withdrawal as specified in that section;

(4) Subsection (3) does not affect the duty to provide the information specified in this section to the adult parent or guardian of the minor where the consent of the adult parent or guardian in addition to the consent of the minor is required under this Part.

### Waiver of appropriate consent by institutional review board

13\.—(1) Despite anything in this Part, an institutional review board which is the reviewing authority of a human biomedical research proposal may waive the requirement —

(a) for the appropriate consent obtained for the participation of a person as a research subject or for the use of human tissue, as the case may be, to be in writing, in such circumstances as are specified in Part 1 of the Fifth Schedule;

(b) to obtain appropriate consent for the use of human biological material or health information, as the case may be, in such circumstances as are specified in Part 2 of the Fifth Schedule; or

(c) to obtain appropriate consent for the participation of a person as a research subject for emergency research in such circumstances as are specified in Part 3 of the Fifth Schedule.

(2) Despite sections 8 and 10, an institutional review board which is the reviewing authority of a human biomedical research proposal may waive the requirement to obtain the appropriate consent of at least one adult parent or guardian for the participation of a minor as a research subject if the board is satisfied that —

(a) the proposed research involves no more than minimal risk to the research subjects;

(b) the waiver of parental consent will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the research subjects; and

(c) the proposed research may not practicably be carried out unless there is such a waiver, and the research proposal —

(i) is designed for conditions or for a research subject population for which parental or guardian consent is not a reasonable requirement to protect the research subjects (such as neglected or abused minors), and an appropriate mechanism for protecting the minors is substituted;

(ii) is of such a private and sensitive nature that it is not reasonable to require permission, (such as adolescents in studies concerning treatment of sexually transmitted diseases); or

(iii) is within the description of such circumstances as may be prescribed.

(3) To avoid doubt —

(a) subsection (1) does not apply to the waiver of consent for the removal of human tissue from a person;

(b) a waiver under subsection (1) or (2) does not affect a person’s duty to protect individually-identifiable information from unauthorised disclosure under sections 29 and 39 or imposed by law; and

(c) nothing in this section provides immunity to the custodian of any individually-identifiable information for such information if disclosed, unless the disclosure was done in accordance with this Act.

(4) A waiver under subsection (1) or (2) has effect despite any obligation as to confidentiality or other restriction upon the disclosure or use of information imposed by law, contract or rules of professional conduct.

(5) A researcher who conducts human biomedical research pursuant to a waiver under subsection (1) or (2) is not treated as being in breach of any obligation as to confidentiality or other restriction upon the disclosure or use of information or material imposed by law, contract or rules of professional conduct.

### Withdrawal of consent

14\.—(1) A research subject or any person who is authorised to give consent on the subject’s behalf under this Part may, at any time, withdraw the consent to the subject’s participation in the human biomedical research.

(2) A donor of human tissue or any person who is authorised to give consent on the donor’s behalf under this Part may, at any time, withdraw the consent to the use of the donor’s tissue for research if —

(a) the tissue is individually-identifiable and has not been used for the research; or

(b) the tissue is individually-identifiable and has been used for the research but it is practicable to discontinue further use of the tissue for the research.

(3) The withdrawal of consent in the circumstances specified in subsection (1) or (2)(b) does not affect the research information obtained before the consent is withdrawn and such information may be retained and used for the research.

(4) Any penalty or damages imposed solely by reason of the withdrawal of consent permitted by this section is void and unenforceable.

22\.—(1) No human biomedical research can be conducted except under the supervision and control of a research institution with —

(a) a place of business in Singapore; and

(b) at least 2 individuals ordinarily resident in Singapore who are responsible on behalf of the research institution for the supervision and control of the biomedical research.

(2) No person can conduct any human biomedical research unless he or she has first complied with all of the following requirements:

(b) he or she has ensured that the proposed research has been —

(i) reviewed and approved by an institutional review board appointed by the research institution referred to in paragraph (a); or

(ii) exempted from review by an institutional review board under section 17(2);

(c) he or she has ensured that, except in such circumstances as may be prescribed, appropriate consent has been obtained in accordance with Part 3 prior to the participation of the research subject or the use of individually-identifiable biological material or health information of the research subject in the proposed research, as the case may be;

(d) he or she has ensured that where the human biomedical research involves human gametes or embryos, whether individually‑identifiable or not, the appropriate consent must be obtained from the research subject or donor who has capacity to give consent in person and not from a person authorised under Part 3 to give consent on the subject’s or donor’s behalf.

(3) A researcher must ensure that —

(a) the research does not deviate from the research proposal that has been reviewed and approved or exempted from review by an institutional review board unless the deviation —

(i) has been reviewed and approved, or otherwise exempted from review, by the institutional review board; or

(ii) is necessary to mitigate an immediate risk of harm to a research subject and the researcher without unreasonable delay informs the institutional review board of the deviation;

(b) any research is immediately discontinued if the institutional review board has withdrawn its approval for the research unless the immediate discontinuation will result in a risk of harm to the research subject;

(c) the further participation of the research subject or further use of the individually-identifiable biological material or health information of the research subject is immediately discontinued if the consent has been withdrawn or is otherwise invalid unless the immediate discontinuation will result in a risk of harm to the research subject; and

(4) A researcher must ensure that a minor who lacks sufficient understanding and intelligence, or an adult or minor who lacks mental capacity to give consent, must not be a research subject in any biomedical research unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that biomedical research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out without the participation of the class of persons to which the minor or adult belongs, as the case may be.

(5) To avoid doubt, the delegation of any obligation or duty under this Act to another person or service provider under a contract or other arrangement does not absolve or relieve the person of any of his or her obligations or duties under this Act.

(6) Any person who contravenes subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
