### Licensing of homes

4\.—(1) Any person who carries on a home for the aged without being licensed under this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

### Refusal to issue licence

5\. The Director may refuse to issue a licence if he is satisfied —

### Revocation and suspension of licence

6\.—(1) The Director may revoke or suspend a licence to use any premises as a home —

(c) if the premises are no longer being used as a home;

(d) if the home does not conform in all respects with minimum standards of accommodation that may be prescribed;

(e) if, in the opinion of the Director, the construction of the home constitutes a fire risk, or the fire-fighting equipment available, or the means of escape provided, or the other precautions taken for avoiding danger from fire, extinguishing fire or otherwise protecting residents from fire, do not conform with the minimum standard required for homes;

(f) if in the opinion of the Director —

(i) the standard of care available to residents in the home is unsatisfactory;

(ii) any resident has been ill-treated or neglected in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or has been kept in an environment that is injurious to his mental or physical health;

(iii) the premises of the home are unsafe for residents or are insanitary; or

(iv) the premises of the home are in such a condition, or the home is managed or conducted in such a manner, that the revocation of the licence is required in the interests of the residents or in the public interest;

(g) if the home does not comply with any requirement under this Act or any of its regulations relating to staff;

(h) if the premises of the home are not repaired or altered as required by the Director;

(i) if a licensee is convicted for contravening any of the provisions of this Act or any of its regulations or if he fails to comply with any direction given by the Director under this Act; or

(j) if a licensee has contravened or if he fails to comply with any of the conditions specified in the licence.

(2) Before revoking or suspending a licence, the Director shall give notice to the licensee of the ground or grounds on which it is proposed to revoke or suspend the licence and shall afford the licensee an opportunity of showing cause why the licence should not be revoked or suspended.
