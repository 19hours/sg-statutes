(4) When the defendant is an employee or agent of the person who purchased the food or appliance under such a warranty or written statement, he shall be entitled to the benefit of this section in the same manner and to the same extent as his employer or principal would have been, if he had been the defendant:

Provided that the employee or agent further proves that he had no reason to believe that the article did not conform to the warranty or statement.

(5) Any person who in respect of any food or appliance sold by him as principal or agent gives to the purchaser a false warranty in writing shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and for any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding $5,000, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that when he gave the warranty he had reason to believe that the statements or descriptions contained therein were true.

### Analyst’s certificate to be prima facie evidence

29\.—(1) The production by the prosecutor of a certificate of analysis purporting to be under the hand of an analyst shall be sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein, unless the defendant requires the analyst to be called as a witness, in which case he shall give notice thereof to the prosecutor not less than 3 clear days before the day on which the summons is returnable.

(2) In like manner the production by the defendant of a certificate of analysis purporting to be under the hand of an analyst shall be sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein, unless the prosecutor requires the analyst to be called as a witness.

(3) A copy of the certificate referred to in subsection (2) shall be sent to the prosecutor at least 3 clear days before the day fixed for the hearing of the summons, and, if it is not so sent, the District Court or the Magistrate’s Court (as the case may be) may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it thinks proper.

### Court may order independent analysis

30\. When a sample has been dealt with in accordance with section 9, the District Court or the Magistrate’s Court shall, on the request of either party to any proceedings for any offence under this Act, and may, if it thinks fit without such request, order the part of the sample retained by an officer to be submitted to another analyst for analysis.

### Non-disclosure of information

31\.—(1) No prosecutor or witness in any prosecution under this Act shall be compelled to disclose the fact that he received any information or the nature of the information or the name of any person who gave the information.

(2) No officer appearing as a prosecutor or witness shall be compelled to produce any confidential report or document made or received by him in his official capacity or to make any statement in relation thereto.

### Recovery of fees and other expenses incidental to prosecution

(2) All such fees and expenses shall be recoverable in the same manner as a fine is recoverable.
