20\. No action, suit or other proceedings shall be brought or instituted in any court against any party to a contract for failing, neglecting or refusing to publish any advertisement relating to smoking, the subject-matter of such contract, where such failure, neglect or refusal is solely attributable to, or occasioned by, the commencement of this Act or any Act amending this Act, but nothing in this section shall affect the operation of the Frustrated Contracts Act (Cap. 115).

(3) For the purpose of satisfying himself as to the identity of the person arrested, the police officer or authorised officer may require such evidence of identity as he may consider necessary to be furnished by the person.

(6) If a person upon whom a notice has been served under subsection (2) fails to appear before a Court in accordance with the notice, the Court may issue a warrant for the arrest of that person.

(7) Where a person arrested in pursuance of a warrant issued under subsection (6) is produced before a Court, the Court shall proceed as though he were produced before it under subsection (1) and shall, at the conclusion of such proceedings, call upon him to show cause why he should not be punished for failing to attend in compliance with the notice served under subsection (2) and, if due cause is not shown, the Court may order him to pay a penalty not exceeding $2,000 or may commit him to prison for a term not exceeding one month.

(2) The Director or an authorised officer may, if he has reasonable cause to believe that an offence under section 3(1) has been committed in respect of an advertisement relating to smoking, require the person reasonably suspected of committing the offence to remove the advertisement from the view of members of the public and if the person fails to do so, the Director or authorised officer may cause the advertisement to be so removed and the person shall be liable to pay to the Director the reasonable costs of removal and disposal of the advertisement which may be recovered as a debt due to the Government.
