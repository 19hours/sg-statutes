GENERAL EXCEPTIONS

### Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound by law

Illustrations

(a)

A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with the commands of the law.Ahas committed no offence.

(b)

A, an officer of a court of justice, being ordered by that court to arrestY, and, after due enquiry, believingZto beY, arrestZ.Ahas committed no offence.

### Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of a court of justice

78\. Nothing which is done in pursuance of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of a court of justice, if done while the judgment or order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the court may have had no jurisdiction to pass the judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the court had such jurisdiction.

### Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified by law

79\. Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.

Illustration

### Accident in the doing of a lawful act

80\. Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, and without any criminal intention or knowledge, in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care and caution.

Illustration

Ais at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part ofA, his act is excusable and not an offence.

### Act likely to cause harm but done without a criminal intent, and to prevent other harm

81\. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.

Explanation1.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.

Illustrations

(a)

A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boatB, with 20 or 30 passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course he must incur risk of running down a boatC, with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, ifAalters his course without any intention to run down the boatC,and in good faith for the purposes of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boatB, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boatC, by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boatC.

(b)

Ain a great fire pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention, in good faith, of saving human life or property.

84\. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.

### Intoxication when a defence

85\.—(1) Except as provided in this section and in section 86, intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge.

(2) Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason thereof the person charged at the time of the act or omission complained of did not know that such act or omission was wrong or did not know what he was doing and —

(a) the state of intoxication was caused without his consent by the malicious or negligent act of another person; or

(b) the person charged was, by reason of intoxication, insane, temporarily or otherwise, at the time of such act or omission.

### Effect of defence of intoxication when established

86\.—(1) Where the defence under section 85 is established, then in a case falling under section 85(2)(a) the accused person shall be acquitted, and in a case falling under section 85(2)(b), section 84 of this Code and sections 314 and 315 of the Criminal Procedure Code [Cap. 67] shall apply.

(2) Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty of the offence.

### Interpretation

(3) For the purposes of this section and section 85 “intoxication” shall be deemed to include a state produced by narcotics or drugs.

### Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent

87\. Nothing, which is not intended to cause death or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person above 18 years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.

Illustrations

AandZagree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and ifA, while playing fairly, hurtsZ,Acommits no offence.

### Act not intended to cause death done by consent in good faith for the benefit of a person

88\. Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.

Illustrations

### Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or person of unsound mind, by or by consent of guardian

89\. Nothing, which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under 12 years of age, or of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to that person:

Provided that this exception shall not extend to —

(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;

(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;

(c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;

(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend.

Illustrations

A, in good faith, for the benefit of his child, being under 12 years of age, without his child’s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon, knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child’s death, but not intending to cause the child’s death.Ais within the exception, inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child.

### Consent known to be given under fear or misconception

90\. A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code —

(a) if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception;

Consent of person of unsound mind

(b) if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or

Consent of child

(c) unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under 12 years of age.

### Acts which are offences independently of harm caused to the person consenting, are not within the exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89

91\. The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given.

Illustrations

Causing miscarriage, unless it is authorised under the Termination of Pregnancy Act [Cap. 324) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the consent of the woman, or of her guardian, to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.

[32/80]

### Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent

92\. Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person’s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit:

Provided that this exception shall not extend to —

(a) the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause death;

(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;

(c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt;

(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend.

People below hold out a blanket.Adrops the child from the house-top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending in good faith, the child’s benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall,Ahas committed no offence.

Explanation—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning sections 88, 89 and 92.

### Communication made in good faith

93\. No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.

Illustration

### Act to which a person is compelled by threats

94\. Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence:

Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint.

Explanation1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins gang-robbers knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.

Explanation2.—A person seized by gang-robbers, and forced by threat of instant death to do a thing which is an offence by law — for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of a house for the gang-robbers to enter and plunder it — is entitled to the benefit of this exception.

### Act causing slight harm

95\. Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.

### Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind

98\. When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind, or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.

Illustrations

(a)

Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to killA.Zis guilty of no offence. ButAhas the same right of private defence which he would have ifZwere sane.

(b)

Aenters, by night, a house which he is legally entitled to enter.Z, in good faith, takingAfor a housebreaker, attacksA. HereZ, by attackingAunder this misconception, commits no offence. ButAhas the same right of private defence againstZ, which he would have ifZwere not acting under that misconception.

### Acts against which there is no right of private defence

99\.—(1) There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by law.

(3) There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.

### Extent to which the right may be exercised

(4) The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.

Explanation1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is such public servant.

Explanation2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting by such direction; or unless such person states the authority under which he acts, or, if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.

### When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death

101\. If the offence is not of any of the descriptions enumerated in section 100, the right of private defence of the body does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.

### Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body

102\. The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence, though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.

### When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death

103\. The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the wrongdoer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, is an offence of any of the following descriptions:

If the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right of private defence, is theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions enumerated in section 103, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrongdoer of any harm other than death.

Offences affecting life

### Culpable homicide

299\. Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.

Illustrations

(a)

Alays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused.Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed.Ahas committed the offence of culpable homicide.

(b)

AknowsZto be behind a bush.Bdoes not know it.A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to causeZ’s death, inducesBto fire at the bush.Bfires and killsZ. HereBmay be guilty of no offence; butAhas committed the offence of culpable homicide.

(c)

A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it killsB, who is behind a bush,Anot knowing that he was there. Here, althoughAwas doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to killB, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.

Explanation1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death.

Explanation2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.

Explanation3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother’s womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.

### Murder

300\. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder —

(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death;

(b) if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused;

(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or

(d) if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death, or such injury as aforesaid.

Illustrations

(a)

AshootsZwith the intention of killing him.Zdies in consequence.Acommits murder.

(b)

A, knowing thatZis labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury.Zdies in consequence of the blow.Ais guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But ifA, not knowing thatZis labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, hereA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.

(c)

Aintentionally givesZa sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature.Zdies in consequence. HereAis guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to causeZ’s death.

When culpable homicide is not murder

Exception1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.

Exception.—The above exception is subject to the following provisos:

(a)

that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person;

(b)

that the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;

(c)

that the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

Explanation—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

Illustrations

(a)
