# Penal Code

(CHAPTER 224)

(Original Enactment: Ordinance 4 of 1871)

REVISED EDITION 2008

(30th November 2008)

An Act to consolidate the law relating to criminal offences.

[16th September 1872]

### Chapter I

Preliminary

### Short title

1\. This Act shall be called the Penal Code.

### Punishment of offences committed within Singapore

2\. Every person shall be liable to punishment under this Code and not otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions thereof, of which he is guilty within Singapore.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 2]

### Punishment of offences committed beyond, but which by law may be tried within Singapore

3\. Any person liable by law to be tried for an offence committed beyond the limits of Singapore, shall be dealt with according to the provisions of this Code for any act committed beyond Singapore, in the same manner as if such act had been committed within Singapore.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 3]

### Jurisdiction over public servants for offences committed outside Singapore

4\. Every public servant who, being a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore, when acting or purporting to act in the course of his employment, commits an act or omission outside Singapore that if committed in Singapore would constitute an offence under the law in force in Singapore, is deemed to have committed that act or omission in Singapore.

[51/2007]

### Certain laws not to be affected by this Code

5\. Nothing in this Code is intended to repeal, vary, suspend, or affect any of the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny and desertion of officers or servicemen in the Singapore Armed Forces, or of any other law for the time being in force.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 5]

### Chapter II

General Explanations

### Definitions in this Code to be understood subject to exceptions

6\. Throughout this Code every definition of an offence, every penal provision, and every illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood subject to the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled “General Exceptions”, though those exceptions are not repeated in such definition, penal provision or illustration.

Illustrations

(a) The sections in this Code which contain definitions of offences, do not express, that a child under 7 years of age cannot commit such offences, but the definitions are to be understood subject to the general exception which provides that “nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under 7 years of age”.

(b)A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehendsZ, who has committed murder. Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement, for he was bound by law to apprehendZ, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it”.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 6]

### Expression once explained is used in the same sense throughout this Code

7\. Every expression which is explained in any part of this Code is used in every part of this Code in conformity with the explanation.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 9]

### “Man” and “woman”

10\. The word “man” denotes a male human being of any age; “woman” denotes a female human being of any age.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 10]

### “Person”

[Indian PC 1860, s. 11]

### “Public”

Illustrations

(a) A Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in respect of a charge on which he has power to sentence to fine or imprisonment, with or without appeal, is a judge.

(b) Officers holding an inquiry as to the loss of a ship under the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap. 179) are judges.

(c) A Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in respect of a charge on which he has power only to commit for trial to another court, is not a judge.

23\. “Wrongful gain” is gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled; “wrongful loss” is loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled.

Explanation.—A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such person acquires wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property.

### Accident in the doing of a lawful act

Illustration

[Indian PC 1860, s. 80]

### Act likely to cause harm but done without a criminal intent, and to prevent other harm

81\. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.

Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.

Illustrations

(a)A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boatB, with 20 or 30 passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course he must incur risk of running down a boatC, with only 2 passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, ifAalters his course without any intention to run down the boatC, and in good faith for the purposes of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boatB, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boatC, by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boatC.

(b)Ain a great fire pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention, in good faith, of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuseA’s act,Ais not guilty of the offence.

(c)X, the commander of a naval vessel, is deployed in response to a threat of a terrorist attack against a ferry terminal in Singapore.Xreceives information that vesselA, with a crew of 6, has been hijacked by terrorists and is approaching the ferry terminal at great speed and is likely to collide into the terminal. There is insufficient time to evacuate the persons at the terminal, which is estimated to be about 100.Xorders vesselAto stop her manoeuvre immediately and fires a warning signal. However, vesselAcontinues her advance towards the terminal. Here, ifXgives an order to fire at vesselAto disable it, without any intention to cause harm to the crew members of vesselA, and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the persons at the terminal, he is not guilty of an offence. This is so even though he knows that he is likely to cause harm to the crew members of vesselA, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger whichXintends to avoid is such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of firing at vesselA.

Nothing, which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under 12 years of age, or of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to that person:

Provided that this exception shall not extend to —

(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;

(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;

(c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;

Illustration

A, in good faith, for the benefit of his child, being under 12 years of age, without his child’s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon, knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child’s death, but not intending to cause the child’s death.Ais within the exception, inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 89]

### Consent given under fear or misconception, by person of unsound mind, etc., and by child

90\. A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code —

(a) if the consent is given by a person —

(i) under fear of injury or wrongful restraint to the person or to some other person; or

(ii) under a misconception of fact,

and the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception;

(b) if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, mental incapacity, intoxication, or the influence of any drug or other substance, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or

(c) unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under 12 years of age.

91\. The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given.

[32/80]

Illustration

Causing miscarriage, unless it is authorised under the Termination of Pregnancy Act (Cap. 324) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the consent of the woman, or of her guardian, to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 91]

### Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent

92\. Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person’s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit:

Provided that this exception shall not extend to —

(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;

(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;

(c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt;

(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend.

(d)Ais in a house which is on fire, withZ, a child. People below hold out a blanket.Adrops the child from the house-top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending in good faith, the child’s benefit.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 92]

### Communication made in good faith

93\. No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 93]

### Act to which a person is compelled by threats

94\. Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person or any other person will otherwise be the consequence:

Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint.

[51/2007]

Explanation1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins gang-robbers knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.

Explanation2.—A person seized by gang-robbers, and forced by threat of instant death to do a thing which is an offence by law — for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of a house for the gang-robbers to enter and plunder it — is entitled to the benefit of this exception.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 94]

### Act causing slight harm

95\. Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.

When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind, or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.

Illustrations

(a)Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to killA.Zis guilty of no offence. ButAhas the same right of private defence which he would have ifZwere sane.

108\. A person abets an offence who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.

Explanation1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence, although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.

Explanation2.—To constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.

Illustrations

(b)A, with the intention of murderingZ, instigatesB, a child under 7 years of age, to do an act which causesZ’s death.B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act, and thereby causesZ’s death. Here, thoughBwas not capable by law of committing an offence,Ais liable to be punished in the same manner as ifBhad been capable by law of committing an offence and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.

(c)AinstigatesBto set fire to a dwelling-house.B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence ofA’s instigation.Bhas committed no offence, butAis guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.

ButAis guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as ifBhad committed theft.

[51/2007]

Explanation4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence.

113\. When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment causes a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect.

Offences affecting life

### Culpable homicide

299\. Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.

Illustrations

(c) [Deleted by Act 51 of 2007]

Explanation1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death.

Explanation2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.

Explanation3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother’s womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 299]

### Murder

300\. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder —

(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death;

(b) if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused;

(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or

(d) if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death, or such injury as aforesaid.

But ifA, not knowing thatZis labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, hereA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.

When culpable homicide is not murder 

Exception1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.

The above exception is subject to the following provisos:

(a)

that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person;

(b)

that the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;

(c)

that the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

Illustrations

(a)A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given byZ, intentionally killsY,Z’s child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.

(b)Ygives grave and sudden provocation toA.A, on this provocation, fires a pistol atY, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to killZ, who is near him, but out of sight.AkillsZ. HereAhas not committed murder but merely culpable homicide.

(c)Ais lawfully arrested byZ, a police officer.Ais excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and killsZ. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.

(d)Aappears as a witness beforeZ, a Magistrate.Zsays that he does not believe a word ofA’s deposition, and thatAhas perjured himself.Ais moved to sudden passion by these words, and killsZ. This is murder.

(e)Aattempts to pullZ’s nose.Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold ofAto prevent him from doing so.Ais moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and killsZ. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.

(f)ZstrikesB.Bis by this provocation excited to violent rage.A, a bystander, intending to take advantage ofB’s rage, and to cause him to killZ, puts a knife intoB’s hand for that purpose.BkillsZwith the knife. HereBmay have committed only culpable homicide, butAis guilty of murder.

[51/2007]

Exception2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law, and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence, without premeditation and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.

Illustration

[Deleted by Act 51 of 2007]

Exception3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant, or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant, and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.

Exception4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.

Exception5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of 18 years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.

Illustration

A, by instigation, voluntarily causesZ, a person under 18 years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account ofZ’s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death.Ahas therefore abetted murder.

Exception6.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender being a woman voluntarily causes the death of her child being a child under the age of 12 months, and at the time of the offence the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child.

Exception7.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.

[Indian PC 1860, s. 300]

301\. If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.

Offences against property

Theft

### Theft

378\. Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.

Explanation1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.

Explanation2.—A moving, effected by the same act which effects the severance, may be a theft.

Explanation3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving, or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.

Explanation4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which in consequence of the motion so caused is moved by that animal.

Explanation5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.

Illustrations

(a)Acuts down a tree onZ’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out ofZ’s possession withoutZ’s consent. Here, as soon asAhas severed the tree, in order to such taking, he has committed theft.

(b)Aputs a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus inducesZ’s dog to follow it. Here, ifA’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out ofZ’s possession without Z’s consent,Ahas committed theft as soon asZ’s dog has begun to followA.

(c) [Deleted by Act 51 of 2007]

(d)A, beingZ’s servant and entrusted byZwith the care ofZ’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate withoutZ’s consent.Ahas committed theft.

(e)Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate toA, the keeper of a warehouse, tillZshall return.Acarries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not inZ’s possession. It could not, therefore, be taken out ofZ’s possession, andAhas not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.

(f)Afinds a ring belonging toZon a table in the house whichZoccupies. Here the ring is inZ’s possession, and ifAdishonestly removes it,Acommits theft.

(g)Afinds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person.Aby taking it commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.

(h)Asees a ring belonging toZlying on a table inZ’s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection,Ahides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found byZ, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. HereA, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.

(i)Adelivers his watch toZ, a jeweller, to be regulated.Zcarries it to his shop.A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out ofZ’s hand, and carries it away. HereA, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.

(j) IfAowes money toZfor repairing the watch, and ifZretains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, andAtakes the watch out ofZ’s possession, with the intention of deprivingZof the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.

(k) Again, ifAhaving pawned his watch toZ, takes it out ofZ’s possession withoutZ’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.

(l)Atakes an article belonging toZout ofZ’s possession, withoutZ’s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money fromZas a reward for its restoration. HereAtakes dishonestly;Ahas therefore committed theft.

(m)A, being on friendly terms withZ, goes intoZ’s library inZ’s absence and takes away a book, withoutZ’s express consent, for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable thatAmay have conceived that he hadZ’s implied consent to useZ’s book. If this wasA’s impression,Ahas not committed theft.

(n)Aasks charity fromZ’s wife. She givesAmoney, food and clothes, whichAknows to belong toZ, her husband. Here, it is probable thatAmay conceive thatZ’s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this wasA’s impression,Ahas not committed theft.

(o)Ais the paramour ofZ’s wife. She givesAvaluable property, whichAknows to belong to her husbandZ, and to be such property as she has no authority fromZto give. IfAtakes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.

(p)Ain good faith, believing property belonging toZto beA’s own property, takes that property out ofB’s possession. Here, asAdoes not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.
