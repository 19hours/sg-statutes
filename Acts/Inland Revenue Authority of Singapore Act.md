(2) An order, ruling or direction made or given by a committee pursuant to this section shall be treated as an order, ruling or direction of the Authority and have the same force or effect as if it had been made or given by the Authority pursuant to the authority vested in the Authority under this Act.

### Misconduct or neglect of duty by employee before transfer

24\. The Authority may reprimand, reduce in rank, retire, dismiss or punish in some other manner a person who had, whilst he was in the employment of the Government, been guilty of any misconduct or neglect of duty which would have rendered him liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished in some other manner if he had continued to be in the employment of the Government and if this Act had not been enacted.
