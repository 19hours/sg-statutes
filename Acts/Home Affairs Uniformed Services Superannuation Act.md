(b) in the case of an officer referred to in subsection (1)(b), that any such officer who opts to join the INVEST Plan shall remain eligible to benefits not less in value than the amount of any gratuity or other like benefit for which he would have been granted under his contract if he had completed his term of service under the contract on the date immediately prior to his joining the INVEST Plan.

(3) Any option exercised by any officer before the commencement of the regulations to join or not to join the INVEST Plan shall be deemed to be exercised in accordance with the regulations made under this section.

### Benefits not as of right

5\. No member shall have an absolute right to compensation for past services or to any pension, gratuity, allowance or other benefit under the INVEST Plan.

### Reduction, etc., of benefits

6\.—(1) Nothing in this Act shall limit the right of the relevant appointing authority to dismiss any member from the uniformed services without compensation.

(2) Subject to Article 113 of the Constitution, where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant appointing authority that a member has been guilty of negligence, irregularity or misconduct, it shall be lawful for the relevant appointing authority to reduce or altogether withhold the pension, gratuity, allowance or other benefit for which the member would but for this section have become eligible under the INVEST Plan.

(3) In this section, “relevant appointing authority” means —

(a) in the case of a member who is a junior police officer, the Commissioner of Police; and

(b) in the case of a member who is a civil defence officer, intelligence officer, narcotics officer, prison officer or senior police officer, the Public Service Commission or any of its delegates.

### Non-assignability or attachment, etc., of benefits

7\. No payments, allowance or other benefit payable under the INVEST Plan (whether on death, retirement or resignation of a member or otherwise), and no contribution by the Government made under the INVEST Plan and no interest thereon shall be assignable or transferable, or liable to be garnished, attached, sequestered or levied upon for or in respect of any debt or claim, other than —

(a) a debt due to the Government; or

(b) an order of court for the payment of periodical sums of money towards the maintenance of the wife or former wife or minor child (whether legitimate or not) of the member to whom the payment, allowance or other benefit has been granted.

### Effect of bankruptcy on benefits

8\.—(1) No contribution by the Government made under the INVEST Plan and no interest thereon shall be subject to the debts of any member thereof, nor shall such contributions and interest pass to the Official Assignee on the bankruptcy of the member, and if the member is adjudicated a bankrupt or is declared insolvent by a court of law, such contributions and interest shall be deemed excluded from the property of the bankrupt for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20).

(2) If, at the date of his retirement or resignation from the uniformed services, any member has been adjudged a bankrupt by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, and he has not obtained his discharge from such adjudication or declaration, it shall be lawful for an award officer to refuse to grant any pension, gratuity or other allowance which would, if not for this subsection, be granted.

(3) If any person to whom a pension or other allowance has been granted under this Act is adjudicated a bankrupt by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, the Minister may direct that such pension or allowance shall forthwith cease, and thereupon such pension or allowance shall cease accordingly.

(4) In any case where, by reason of bankruptcy of the former member, a pension, gratuity or allowance is not granted or where a pension or allowance ceases by virtue of a direction under subsection (3), it shall be lawful for the Minister, from time to time, during the remainder of the member’s or former member’s life, or during such shorter period or periods, either continuous or discontinuous, as the Minister thinks fit, to cause all or any part of the moneys to which such person would have been entitled by way of pension, gratuity or allowance, had he not become a bankrupt, to be paid to, or applied for the maintenance and personal support or benefit of, all or any (to the exclusion of the others) of the following persons in such proportions and manner as the Minister thinks proper:

(a) the member or former member himself; and

(b) any wife, child or children of his.

(5) When a person to whom a pension or allowance has not been granted or whose pension or allowance has ceased under this section obtains a full and proper discharge from his bankruptcy, his pension or allowance shall be restored to him with effect from the date of such discharge.

(6) For the purposes of subsection (4), moneys applied for the discharge of the debts of the member or former member, as the case may be, shall be regarded as applied for his benefit.

### Benefits to cease on conviction

9\.—(1) If any person to whom a pension or other allowance has been granted under this Act is sentenced to death or penal servitude or any term of imprisonment, by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, for any crime or offence, the Minister may direct that such pension or allowance shall forthwith cease, and thereupon such pension or allowance shall cease accordingly.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), any pension or allowance that has ceased by virtue of a direction under subsection (1) shall be restored with retrospective effect in the case of a person who, after conviction, at any time receives a free pardon.

(3) Where a pension or allowance ceases by virtue of a direction under subsection (1), it shall be lawful for the Minister to cause all or any part of moneys to which the person would have been entitled by way of pension or allowance to be paid to or applied for the benefit of his wife, child or children, or after the expiration of his sentence, also for the benefit of himself, in the same manner precisely and subject to the same qualifications and restrictions as in the case of bankruptcy provided in section 8.

### Benefits not part of member’s estate

10\. Subject to the provisions of any regulations made under this Part, all moneys paid or payable under the INVEST Plan on the death of a member thereof shall be deemed to be subject to a trust in favour of the persons entitled thereto under the will or intestacy of such deceased member and shall not be deemed to form part of his estate or be subject to the payment of his debts but shall be deemed to be property passing on his death for the purposes of the Estate Duty Act (Cap. 96).

### Recovery of benefits granted in ignorance of disqualifying facts

11\. It shall be a condition of the grant of every pension, gratuity, allowance or other benefit under the INVEST Plan that the Government may recover, cancel or reduce the grant if it be shown to have been obtained by the wilful suppression of material facts or to have been granted in ignorance of facts which, had they been known before the retirement or resignation of the member, would have justified his dismissal or a reduction of his salary.

## PART III

INVEST FUND

### Establishment of INVEST Fund

12\.—(1) There shall be established a fund to be called the INVEST Fund into which shall be paid all the following moneys:

(a) such sums appropriated from the Consolidated Fund and authorised to be paid into the Fund by or under any written law to enable the Fund to meet its liabilities under this Act or any other written law;

(b) all revenues of Singapore allocated by written law to the Fund; and

(c) the net income from investments of moneys in the Fund authorised to be made by this Act or any other written law.
