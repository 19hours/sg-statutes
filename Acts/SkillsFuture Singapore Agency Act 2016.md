(b) is each transferred to the service, and becomes an employee, of the Agency on terms no less favourable than those enjoyed by the employee on the eve of the transfer date.

(2) The transfer of a transferring SWDA employee to the Agency —

(a) does not interrupt continuity of service;

(c) does not entitle any employee so transferred to any payment or other benefit merely because he or she stops being employed by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency.

(a) a transferred employee retains all accrued rights as if employment with the Agency were a continuation of employment with the Singapore Workforce Development Agency;

(b) the liabilities of the Singapore Workforce Development Agency relating to the transferred employee’s accrued rights to annual, sick, maternity or other leave and superannuation become the liabilities of the Agency; and

(3) For any conduct whilst a transferred employee was employed by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency which would have rendered the employee liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency, the Agency may —

(a) carry on and complete any disciplinary proceedings started by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency against the transferred employee if those proceedings are pending on the eve of the transfer date; and

(5) Until such time as conditions of employment are drawn up by the Agency for the transferred employees, every transferred employee is to be regarded as being employed by the Agency on the same conditions of employment applicable to the employee on the eve of the transfer date as the Singapore Workforce Development Agency.

(6) Any condition of employment relating to the length of service with the Agency must recognise the length of service of the employees so transferred while in the employment of the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (including any previous service of the employee taken to be service with the Singapore Workforce Development Agency) to be service with the Agency.

(7) Neither the chief executive of the CPE nor the chief executive of the SWDA is by operation of this Part transferred to the position of Chief Executive of the Agency unless the Agency appoints him or her to that position under section 38.

(8) Nothing in section 67(6) —

(a) breaks the continuity of service of the public officer whose secondment continues with the Agency because of that provision; or

(b) affects any rights, powers or immunities that such a public officer has, or the extent to which such a public officer is subject to obligations or liabilities in relation to discipline, by virtue of holding the office or position to which the officer is seconded.

### Transfer of records

69\. From the transfer date, the following records become the records of the Agency:
