(b) who was a citizen of Singapore on 31 December 1986 and has been a citizen of Singapore since that date.

(2) In addition, any other citizen of Singapore may be determined under section 13 to be a Pioneer for the purposes of this Act provided that the citizen’s birthday is 31 December 1949 or earlier.

### Determination to be a Pioneer

13\.—(1) For the purpose of determining whether a citizen of Singapore referred to in section 12(2) is a Pioneer for the purposes of this Act, the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel is to have regard to, and give such weight as the Panel considers appropriate to, all of such matters as are prescribed by regulations.

(2) A citizen of Singapore referred to in section 12(2) may not be determined to be a Pioneer for the purposes of this Act unless a verification application is made, by or on behalf of the citizen, to the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel in the prescribed manner.

(3) A verification application may be made —

(a) by the individual who wants to be determined to be a Pioneer;

(b) with the approval of the individual, by another person on behalf of that individual; or

(4) However, verification applications must be made no later than the closing date specified by the Minister under subsection (5), and the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel must reject any verification application made after that date.

(5) The Minister may specify the closing date for the purposes of subsection (4) by a notification in theGazettepublished at least 6 months before the closing date so specified.

(6) On receiving a verification application under subsection (2) in respect of any individual, the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel is to determine as soon as practicable whether or not the individual is a Pioneer.

(7) If the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel determines that a citizen of Singapore referred to in section 12(2) is a Pioneer for the purposes of this Act, the Panel may, where suitable, state that the citizen of Singapore is a Pioneer with effect from a date before the date of its decision, but not a date that is earlier than when the verification application for that citizen of Singapore was received by the Panel.

(8) The Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel must give to the person referred to in subsection (3) who made a verification application notice of its decision under this section on the verification application.

### Reconsideration by Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel

14\.—(1) A person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel under this section or section 13 of refusing to determine that a citizen of Singapore referred to in section 12(2) is a Pioneer may, at any time but no later than the closing date specified under section 13(5), apply in writing to that Panel to reconsider that decision.

(2) An application for reconsideration may be made by any person referred to in section 13(3) and must be made in the prescribed manner, except that the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel must reject any application for reconsideration made after the closing date specified under section 13(5).

(3) On receiving an application under subsection (1) for reconsideration of its decision in respect of any citizen of Singapore referred to in section 12(2), the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel is to reconsider the decision, as soon as practicable, and then either —

(a) determine that the citizen of Singapore is a Pioneer with effect from a date to be specified, which may, where suitable, be a date before the date of its decision on reconsideration but not earlier than the date the verification application for that citizen of Singapore was received by the Panel under section 13; or

(b) affirm that decision.

(4) The Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel must give notice of the result of its reconsideration under this section to the person who applied under this section for that reconsideration.

### Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel

15\.—(1) There is established a Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel comprising —

(a) a chairperson;

(b) a deputy chairperson; and

(c) at least 2 other individuals and not more than 8 other individuals,

all of whom are appointed by the Minister.

(3) Unless otherwise provided by or under this Act, the Pioneer Generation Appeals Panel may determine the procedure to be adopted by it in considering and re‑considering a verification application under sections 13(2) and 14, respectively.

### Pioneer generation benefits

16\.—(1) The financial assistance to which a Pioneer is eligible under this Act is as follows:

(a) a cash grant to be credited to the Medisave account or other account of the Pioneer in the Central Provident Fund, being of an amount prescribed for the Pioneer or the class that the Pioneer belongs;

(b) a cash grant payable in such other manner of an amount prescribed for the Pioneer if he or she has any disability or satisfies such other conditions as may be prescribed for the grant;

(d) a subsidy of the cost of any relevant health service rendered or provided to the Pioneer by any prescribed healthcare provider, up to the maximum proportion or maximum amount of that cost prescribed for the Pioneer.

(b) a prescribed healthcare provider referred to in subsection (1)(d) is party to or bound by that arrangement;

(c) that prescribed healthcare provider renders or provides any relevant health service to a Pioneer; and

(2) The use or disclosure of confidential information, without the written consent of the individual to whom the information relates, is authorised only if the purpose of the use or disclosure is to communicate or manage the confidential information as part of —

(a) in underwriting a contract of insurance that covers a healthcare provider referred to in section 16;

(b) in determining whether to enter into a contract of insurance that covers such a healthcare provider (whether alone or as a member of a class);

(c) in determining whether a contract of insurance covers such a healthcare provider in relation to a particular event; or

(d) in employing a Pioneer.

(4) Any person who contravenes subsection (2) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
