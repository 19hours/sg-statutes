An Act to facilitate military manoeuvres and firing exercises.

[16th September 1963]

### Short title

1\. This Act may be cited as the Military Manoeuvres Act.

### Notice of manoeuvres

2\.—(1) Whenever the number of troops to be engaged in military manoeuvres exceeds 500 notice in writing shall be given to the Secretary to the Armed Forces Council at least one month before the date on which it is proposed to execute such manoeuvres, specifying the date of the commencement of the manoeuvres, the period not exceeding 3 months during which and approximately the limits within which the manoeuvres are to be executed. The notice shall also specify a date not earlier than one month from the conclusion of the manoeuvres within which claims for compensation arising from the putting in force of the provisions of this Act shall be sent to the Secretary to the Armed Forces Council.

[8/83]

### Publication of notice

(2) The Secretary to the Armed Forces Council shall cause copies of such notice to be posted in every village and at other convenient places within the limits therein mentioned at least 14 days before the day named for the commencement of the manoeuvres.

### When no notice is necessary

(3) Whenever the number of troops to be engaged in the manoeuvres does not exceed 500 no such notice as mentioned in subsection (1) shall be necessary:

Provided that where no such notice is given the manoeuvres shall not extend beyond a period of 48 hours.

### Powers of persons engaged in manoeuvres

3\.—(1) When any military manoeuvres are being executed under this Act such persons as are engaged in the manoeuvres may within the limits specified in the notice, if any, as aforesaid and during the specified period —

(a) pass over and encamp, construct military works not of a permanent character and execute military manoeuvres on any land;

(b) supply themselves with water from any sources of water, public or private, and for that purpose dam up any running water:

Provided that such damming does not interfere with any trade or industry and that nothing in this Act shall authorise the taking of water from any source of supply belonging to a private owner or public authority except subject to the supply shown to be required by those entitled to use the water supply.

(2) Nothing in this Act shall authorise entry on or interference with any dwelling-house, place of worship, school, factory, store or premises used for the carrying on of any business or manufacture or any ground attached to any place of worship or school or any premises enclosed within the curtilage of or attached to any dwelling-house.

### Compensation for damage

4\. Full compensation shall be paid for any injury or damage to persons or property or interference with rights or privileges arising from putting in force any of the provisions of this Act, whether or not occasioned by the acts or defaults of the forces engaged in the manoeuvres, including therein all expenses reasonably incurred in the protection of persons, property, rights and privileges, and any damage by reason of excessive weight or extraordinary traffic caused to any highway for the repair of which any public body or any individual is responsible. The compensation shall be paid to all persons who send in their claims to the Secretary to the Armed Forces Council within the period named in the notice or, if there is no such notice, to the Secretary within one month from the conclusion of the manoeuvres.

[8/83]

### Assessment of compensation

5\.—(1) If the amount of compensation is not settled by agreement between the Armed Forces Council and the claimant, the difference between them shall be referred to arbitration, and the sending in of a claim for compensation shall be treated as a submission to arbitration under the Arbitration Act [Cap. 10].

(2) The reference shall be to two arbitrators having power to appoint an umpire under that Act.

[8/83]

(a) wilfully and unlawfully interferes with the execution of the manoeuvres;

(b) without due authority enters or remains in any camp;

(c) without due authority moves any flag or other mark distinguishing for the purposes of the manoeuvres any lands; or

(d) maliciously cuts or damages any telegraph or telephone wire laid down by or for the use of the forces engaged in the manoeuvres,

he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

(2) Such person may be arrested without a warrant and any animal or vehicle under his charge may be removed by any police officer or by order of any commissioned officer of the forces engaged in the manoeuvres.

[8/83]

### Manoeuvres not to be held in catchment area of waterworks

8\.—(1) It shall be lawful for the President from time to time by proclamation to declare —

(a) that any area specified in the proclamation shall be a manoeuvring ground;

(b) that any area specified in the proclamation shall be a firing ground;

and from time to time in the like manner to declare that any such area or part of that area shall cease to be a manoeuvring ground or a firing ground, as the case may be.

(2) A manoeuvring ground may include any land, sea, tidal water or shore on which or over which aircraft can manoeuvre or from which they can take off or on which they can alight.

(3) A firing ground may include any land, sea, tidal water or shore on which or over which artillery or rifle practices, air firing, bomb dropping or torpedo dropping practices can be carried out, whether from weapons on the ground or from aircraft in flight.

### Powers of Armed Forces Council with respect to manoeuvring ground

9\.—(1) The Armed Forces Council shall have the following powers in respect of any manoeuvring ground so declared under this Act:

(a) it may at any time direct military or air force manoeuvres to be carried on within the manoeuvring ground without giving the notice required by section 2;

(b) it may exercise with respect to the performance of manoeuvres within the manoeuvring ground all the powers for the purpose of military manoeuvres as set out in section 3.

(a) exclude all persons not engaged in the military or air force exercises from the whole or any part of the firing ground;

(b) regulate the conduct of any persons permitted to be within the firing ground while the exercises are being carried on; and

(c) prescribe a penalty not exceeding $2,000 or 6 months’ imprisonment or both for any contravention of any rule.

[8/83]

(2) All such rules shall be published in theGazette, and copies thereof in Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English shall be posted in at least 3 conspicuous places within or near the firing ground.

(3) If any such rules injuriously affect or obstruct the exercise of any private right of any person in or over any sea, tidal water or shore, that person shall be entitled to compensation, and the compensation shall, in case of dispute, be ascertained in the manner provided by section 13.

(4) Any such rules which affect any public right shall be presented to Parliament and shall not come into force until approved, with or without amendment, by a resolution of Parliament. For the purposes of this subsection, “public right” means any right of navigation, anchoring or fishing.

(5) Where an area to which rules made under this section apply consists of any sea or tidal water, or the shore thereof, and the boundaries of the area cannot, in the opinion of the Armed Forces Council, be conveniently marked by permanent marks, those boundaries shall be deemed to be sufficiently marked for the purposes of this Act if sufficient means are taken to warn the public from entering the area.

[8/83]

(6) Any officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer or military policeman of the Singapore Armed Forces or any police officer may arrest without warrant any person found in any firing ground in contravention of the rules made under this section and may remove him and any animal or vehicle under his charge.

(2) The amount of such compensation shall be such as is agreed upon between the Armed Forces Council and the claimant, and if the amount of the compensation cannot be settled by agreement, the difference between the parties shall be referred to arbitration, and the sending in of a claim for compensation shall be treated as a submission to arbitration under the Arbitration Act [Cap. 10].

(3) The reference shall be to two arbitrators having power to appoint an umpire under that Act.

[8/83]
