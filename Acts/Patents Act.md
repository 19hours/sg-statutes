## PART III

Patentability

### Patentable inventions

13\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), a patentable invention is one that satisfies the following conditions:

(a) the invention is new;

(b) it involves an inventive step; and

(c) it is capable of industrial application.

[40/95]

(2) An invention the publication or exploitation of which would be generally expected to encourage offensive, immoral or anti-social behaviour is not a patentable invention.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), behaviour shall not be regarded as offensive, immoral or anti-social only because it is prohibited by any law in force in Singapore.

### Novelty

14\.—(1) An invention shall be taken to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art.

(2) The state of the art in the case of an invention shall be taken to comprise all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either, or anything else) which has at any time before the priority date of that invention been made available to the public (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) by written or oral description, by use or in any other way.

(3) The state of the art in the case of an invention to which an application for a patent or a patent relates shall be taken also to comprise matter contained in an application for another patent which was published on or after the priority date of that invention, if the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) that matter was contained in the application for that other patent both as filed and as published; and

(b) the priority date of that matter is earlier than that of the invention.

(4) For the purposes of this section, the disclosure of matter constituting an invention shall be disregarded in the case of a patent or an application for a patent if occurring later than the beginning of the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of filing the application for the patent and either —

(a) the disclosure was due to, or made in consequence of, the matter having been obtained unlawfully or in breach of confidence by any person —

(i) from the inventor or from any other person to whom the matter was made available in confidence by the inventor or who obtained it from the inventor because he or the inventor believed that he was entitled to obtain it; or

(ii) from any other person to whom the matter was made available in confidence by any person mentioned in sub-paragraph (i) or in this sub-paragraph or who obtained it from any person so mentioned because he or the person from whom he obtained it believed that he was entitled to obtain it;

(b) the disclosure was made in breach of confidence by any person who obtained the matter in confidence from the inventor or from any other person to whom it was made available, or who obtained it, from the inventor;

(c) the disclosure was due to, or made in consequence of, the inventor displaying the invention at an international exhibition and the applicant states, on filing the application, that the invention has been so displayed and also, within the prescribed period, files written evidence in support of the statement complying with any prescribed condition; or

(d) the disclosure was due to, or made in consequence of, the inventor describing the invention in a paper read by him or another person with his consent or on his behalf before any learned society or published with his consent in the transactions of any learned society.

(5) In subsection (4)(d), “learned society” includes any club or association constituted in Singapore or elsewhere whose main object is the promotion of any branch of learning or science.

(6) In this section, references to the inventor include references to any proprietor of the invention for the time being.

(7) In the case of an invention consisting of a substance or composition for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body, the fact that the substance or composition forms part of the state of the art shall not prevent the invention from being taken to be new if the use of the substance or composition in any such method does not form part of the state of the art.

### Inventive step

15\. An invention shall be taken to involve an inventive step if it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art, having regard to any matter which forms part of the state of the art by virtue only of section 14(2) and without having regard to section 14(3).

### Industrial application

16\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), an invention shall be taken to be capable of industrial application if it can be made or used in any kind of industry, including agriculture.

(2) An invention of a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body shall not be taken to be capable of industrial application.

(3) Subsection (2) shall not prevent a product consisting of a substance or composition from being treated as capable of industrial application merely because it is invented for use in any such method.

### Priority date

17\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, the priority date of an invention to which an application for a patent relates and also of any matter (whether or not the same as the invention) contained in the application is, except as provided by the provisions of this Act, the date of filing the application.

(2) If in or in connection with an application for a patent (the application in suit) a declaration is made, whether by the applicant or any predecessor in title of his, complying with the relevant requirements of the rules and specifying one or more earlier relevant applications for the purposes of this section made by the applicant or a predecessor in title of his and each having a date of filing during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of filing the application in suit, then —

(a) if an invention to which the application in suit relates is supported by matter disclosed in the earlier relevant application or applications, the priority date of that invention shall instead of being the date of filing the application in suit be the date of filing the relevant application in which that matter was disclosed or, if it was disclosed in more than one relevant application, the earliest of them; and

(b) the priority date of any matter contained in the application in suit which was also disclosed in the earlier relevant application or applications shall be the date of filing the relevant application in which that matter was disclosed or, if it was disclosed in more than one relevant application, the earliest of them.

(3) Where an invention or other matter contained in the application in suit was also disclosed in 2 earlier relevant applications filed by the same applicant as in the case of the application in suit or a predecessor in title of his and the second of those relevant applications was specified in or in connection with the application in suit, the second of those relevant applications shall, so far as it concerns that invention or matter, be disregarded unless —

(a) it was filed in or in respect of the same country as the first; and

(b) not later than the date of filing the second, the first (whether or not so specified) was unconditionally withdrawn, or was abandoned or refused, without —

(i) having been made available to the public whether in Singapore or elsewhere;

(ii) leaving any right outstanding; and

(iii) having served to establish a priority date in relation to another application, wherever made.

(4) This section shall apply for determining the priority date of an invention for which a patent has been granted as it applies for determining the priority date of an invention to which an application for that patent relates.

(5) In this section and section 18, “relevant application” means any of the following applications which has a date of filing:

(a) an application for a patent under this Act; or

(b) an application in or for a convention country for protection in respect of an invention or an application which, in accordance with the law of a convention country or a treaty or international convention to which a convention country is a party, is equivalent to such an application.

[30/2001]

(6) In subsection (5), “convention country” means —

(a) a country other than Singapore that is a party to the Paris Convention or a member of the World Trade Organisation; or

(b) any other country with which Singapore has entered into a treaty, convention, arrangement or engagement and which is declared by the Minister, by order published in theGazette, as a convention country.

[30/2001]

### Disclosure of matter, etc., between earlier and later applications

18\.—(1) It is hereby declared for the avoidance of doubt that where an application (the application in suit) is made for a patent and a declaration is made in accordance with section 17(2) in or in connection with that application specifying an earlier relevant application, the application in suit and any patent granted in pursuance of it shall not be invalidated by reason only of the relevant intervening acts.

(2) In subsection (1), “relevant intervening acts” means acts done in relation to matter disclosed in an earlier relevant application between the dates of the earlier relevant application and the application in suit, as for example, filing another application for the invention for which the earlier relevant application was made, making information available to the public about that invention or that matter or working that invention, but disregarding any application, or the disclosure to the public of matter contained in any application, which is itself to be disregarded for the purposes of section 17(3).

## PART IV

Right to Apply for and Obtain Patent

### Right to apply for and obtain patent

19\.—(1) Any person may make an application for a patent either alone or jointly with another.

(2) A patent for an invention may be granted —

(a) primarily to the inventor or joint inventors;

(b) in preference to paragraph (a), to any person or persons who, by virtue of any enactment or rule of law, or any foreign law or treaty or international convention, or by virtue of an enforceable term of any agreement entered into with the inventor before the making of the invention, was or were at the time of the making of the invention entitled to the whole of the property in it (other than equitable interests) in Singapore; or

(c) in any event, to the successor or successors in title of any person or persons mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) or any person so mentioned and the successor or successors in title of another person so mentioned,

and to no other person.

(3) Except so far as the contrary is established, a person who makes an application for a patent shall be taken to be the person who is entitled under subsection (2) to be granted a patent and 2 or more persons who make such an application jointly shall be taken to be the persons so entitled.

### Determination before grant of questions about entitlement to patents, etc.

20\.—(1) At any time before a patent has been granted for an invention —

(a) any person may refer to the Registrar the question whether he is entitled to be granted (alone or with any other persons) a patent for that invention or has or would have any right in or under any patent so granted or any application for such a patent; or

(b) any of 2 or more co-proprietors of an application for a patent for that invention may so refer the question whether any right in or under application should be transferred or granted to any other person,

and the Registrar shall determine the question and may make such order as he thinks fit to give effect to the determination.

(2) Where a person refers a question relating to an invention under subsection (1)(a) to the Registrar after an application for a patent for the invention has been filed and before a patent is granted in pursuance of the application, then, unless the application is refused or withdrawn before the reference is disposed of by the Registrar, the Registrar may, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) and subject to subsection (6) —

(a) order that the application shall proceed in the name of that person, either solely or jointly with that of any other applicant or any specified applicant;

(b) where the reference was made by 2 or more persons, order that the application shall proceed in all their names jointly;

(c) refuse to grant a patent in pursuance of the application or order the application to be amended so as to exclude any of the matter in respect of which the question was referred; or

(d) make an order transferring or granting any licence or other right in or under the application and give directions to any person for carrying out the provisions of any such order.

(3) Where a question is referred to the Registrar under subsection (1)(a) and —

(a) the Registrar orders an application for a patent for the invention to which the question relates to be so amended;

(b) any such application is refused under subsection (2)(c) before the Registrar has disposed of the reference (whether the reference was made before or after the publication of the application); or

(c) any such application is refused under any other provision of this Act or is withdrawn before the Registrar has disposed of the reference, but after the publication of the application,

the Registrar may order that any person by whom the reference was made may within the prescribed period make a new application for a patent for the whole or part of any matter comprised in the earlier application or, as the case may be, for all or any of the matter excluded from the earlier application, subject in either case to section 84, and in either case that, if such a new application is made, it shall be treated as having been filed on the date of filing the earlier application.

(4) Where a person refers a question under subsection (1)(b) relating to an application, any order under subsection (1) may contain directions to any person for transferring or granting any right in or under the application.

(5) If any person to whom directions have been given under subsection (2)(d) or (4) fails to do anything necessary for carrying out any such directions within 14 days after the date of the directions, the Registrar may, on application made to him by any person in whose favour or on whose reference the directions were given, authorise him to do that thing on behalf of the person to whom the directions were given.

(6) Where on a reference under this section it is alleged that, by virtue of any transaction, instrument or event relating to an invention or an application for a patent, any person other than the inventor or the applicant for the patent has become entitled to be granted (whether alone or with any other persons) a patent for the invention or has or would have any right in or under any patent so granted or any application for any such patent, an order shall not be made under subsection (2)(a), (b) or (d) on the reference unless notice of the reference is given to the applicant and any such person, except any of them who is a party to the reference.

(7) If it appears to the Registrar on a reference of a question under this section that the question involves matters which would more properly be determined by the court, he may decline to deal with it and, without prejudice to the court’s jurisdiction to determine any such question and make a declaration, the court shall have jurisdiction to do so.

(8) No direction shall be given under this section so as to affect the mutual rights or obligations of trustees or of the personal representatives of deceased persons, or their rights or obligations as such.

### Determination after grant of questions referred before grant

21\. If a question with respect to a patent or application is referred by any person to the Registrar under section 20, and is not determined before the time when the application is first in order for a grant of a patent in pursuance of the application, that fact shall not prevent the grant of a patent, but on its grant that person shall be treated as having referred to the Registrar under section 47 any question mentioned in that section which the Registrar thinks appropriate.

### Handling of application by joint applicants

22\. If any dispute arises between joint applicants for a patent whether or in what manner the application should be proceeded with, the Registrar may, on a request made by any of the parties, give such directions as he thinks fit for enabling the application to proceed in the name of one or more of the parties alone or for regulating the manner in which it shall be proceeded with, or for both those purposes, as the case may require.

### Effect of transfer of application under section 20 or 22

23\.—(1) Where an order is made or directions are given under section 20 or 22 that an application for a patent shall proceed in the name of one or some of the original applicants (whether or not it is also to proceed in the name of some other person), any licences or other rights in or under the application shall, subject to the provisions of the order and any directions under either of those sections, continue in force and be treated as granted by the persons in whose name the application is to proceed.

(2) Where an order is made or directions are given under section 20 that an application for a patent shall proceed in the name of one or more persons none of whom was an original applicant (on the ground that the original applicant or applicants was or were not entitled to be granted the patent), any licences or other rights in or under the application shall, subject to the provisions of the order and any directions under that section and subject to subsection (3), lapse on the registration of the person or those persons as the applicant or applicants or, where the application has not been published, on the making of the order.

(3) If before registration of a reference under section 20 resulting in the making of any order mentioned in subsection (2) —

(a) the original applicant or any of the applicants, acting in good faith, worked the invention in question in Singapore or made effective and serious preparations to do so; or

(b) a licensee of the applicant, acting in good faith, worked the invention in Singapore or made effective and serious preparations to do so,

that or those original applicant or applicants or the licensee shall, on making a request within the prescribed period to the person in whose name the application is to proceed, be entitled to be granted a licence (but not an exclusive licence) to continue working or, as the case may be, to work the invention.

(4) Any such licence shall be granted for a reasonable period and on reasonable terms.

(5) Where an order is made as mentioned in subsection (2), the person in whose name the application is to proceed or any person claiming that he is entitled to be granted any such licence may refer to the Registrar the question whether the latter is so entitled and whether any such period is or terms are reasonable.

(6) The Registrar shall determine the question under subsection (5) and may, if he considers it appropriate, order the grant of such a licence.

### Mention of inventor

24\.—(1) The inventor or joint inventors of an invention shall have a right to be mentioned as such in any patent granted for the invention and shall also have a right to be so mentioned if possible in any published application for a patent for the invention and, if not so mentioned, a right to be so mentioned in accordance with the rules in a prescribed document.

(2) Unless he has already given the Registry the information mentioned in this subsection, an applicant for a patent shall, within the prescribed period, file with the Registry a statement —

(a) identifying the person or persons whom he believes to be the inventor or inventors; and

(b) where the applicant is not the sole inventor or the applicants are not the joint inventors, indicating the derivation of his or their right to be granted the patent,

and, if he fails to do so, the application shall be treated as having been abandoned.

(3) Where a person has been mentioned as a sole or joint inventor under this section, any other person who alleges that the former ought not to have been mentioned may at any time apply to the Registrar for a certificate to that effect, and the Registrar may issue such a certificate.

(7) The purpose of the abstract is to give technical information and on publication it shall not form part of the state of the art by virtue of section 14(3), and the Registrar may determine whether the abstract adequately fulfils its purpose and, if it does not, may reframe it so that it does.

(8) An application for a patent may be withdrawn at any time before the patent is granted and any withdrawal of such an application may not be revoked.

(5) If before the grant of a patent under section 30 it is found that any drawing referred to in any such application is filed later than the date which by virtue of subsection (1) is to be treated as the date of filing the application, the Registrar shall give the applicant an opportunity of requesting within the prescribed period that the date on which the drawing is filed shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the date of filing the application, and —

(a) if the applicant makes any such request, the date of filing the drawing shall be so treated; but

(b) otherwise any reference to the drawing in the application shall be treated as omitted.

(6) Where, after an application for a patent has been filed and before the patent is granted, a new application is filed by the original applicant or his successor in title in accordance with the rules in respect of any part of the matter contained in the earlier application and the considerations mentioned in subsection (1) are satisfied in relation to the new application (without the new application contravening section 84) the new application shall be treated as having, as its date of filing, the date of filing the earlier application.

(8) Anything done under or in relation to the patent during the period between expiry and restoration shall be treated as valid.

(9) Anything done during that period which would have constituted an infringement if the patent had not expired shall be treated as an infringement —

(a) if done at a time when it was possible for the patent to be renewed under section 36(3);

### Determination of right to patent after grant

47\.—(1) After a patent has been granted for an invention, any person having or claiming a proprietary interest in or under the patent may refer to the Registrar the question —

(a) who is or are the true proprietor or proprietors of the patent;

(b) whether the patent should have been granted to the person or persons to whom it was granted; or

(c) whether any right in or under the patent should be transferred or granted to any other person or persons,

and the Registrar shall determine the question and make such order as he thinks fit to give effect to the determination.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), an order under that subsection may contain provision —

(a) directing that the person by whom the reference is made under that subsection shall be included (whether or not to the exclusion of any other person) among the persons registered as proprietors of the patent;

(b) directing the registration of a transaction, instrument or event by virtue of which that person has acquired any right in or under the patent;

(c) granting any licence or other right in or under the patent; and

(d) directing the proprietor of the patent or any person having any right in or under the patent to do anything specified in the order as necessary to carry out the other provisions of the order.

(3) If any person to whom directions have been given under subsection (2)(d) fails to do anything necessary for carrying out any such directions within 14 days after the date of the order containing the directions, the Registrar may, on an application made to him by any person in whose favour or on whose reference the order containing the directions was made, authorise him to do that thing on behalf of the person to whom the directions were given.

(4) Where the Registrar finds on a reference under this section that the patent was granted to a person not entitled to be granted that patent (whether alone or with other persons) and on an application made under section 80 makes an order on that ground for the conditional or unconditional revocation of the patent, the Registrar may order that the person by whom the application was made or his successor in title may, subject to section 84, make a new application for a patent —

(a) in the case of unconditional revocation, for the whole of the matter comprised in the specification of that patent; and

(b) in the case of conditional revocation, for the matter which in the opinion of the Registrar should be excluded from that specification by amendment under section 83,

and where such a new application is made, it shall be treated as having been filed on the date of filing the application for the patent to which the reference relates.

(5) On any reference under subsection (1) —

(a) no order shall be made under this section transferring the patent to which the reference relates on the ground that the patent was granted to a person not so entitled; and

(b) no order shall be made under subsection (4) on that ground if the reference was made after the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the date of the grant, unless it is shown that any person registered as a proprietor of the patent knew at the time of the grant or, as the case may be, of the transfer of the patent to him that he was not entitled to the patent.

(6) An order under this section shall not be so made as to affect the mutual rights or obligations of trustees or of the personal representatives of a deceased person, or their rights or obligations as such.

(7) Where a question is referred to the Registrar under this section, an order shall not be made by virtue of subsection (2) or under subsection (4) on the reference unless notice of the reference is given to all persons registered as proprietor of the patent or as having a right in or under the patent, except those who are parties to the reference.

(8) If it appears to the Registrar on a reference under this section that the question referred to him would more properly be determined by the court, he may decline to deal with it and, without prejudice to the court’s jurisdiction to determine any such question and make a declaration, the court shall have jurisdiction to do so.

(9) The court shall not in the exercise of any such declaratory jurisdiction determine a question whether a patent was granted to a person not entitled to be granted the patent if the proceedings in which the jurisdiction is invoked were commenced after the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the date of the grant of the patent, unless it is shown that any person registered as a proprietor of the patent knew at the time of the grant or, as the case may be, of the transfer of the patent to him that he was not entitled to the patent.

### Effect of transfer of patent under section 47

48\.—(1) Where an order is made under section 47 that a patent shall be transferred from any person or persons (the old proprietor or proprietors) to one or more persons (whether or not including an old proprietor) then, except in a case falling within subsection (2), any licences or other rights granted or created by the old proprietor or proprietors shall, subject to section 43 and to the provisions of the order, continue in force and be treated as granted by the person or persons to whom the patent is ordered to be transferred (the new proprietor or proprietors).

(2) Where an order is so made that a patent shall be transferred from the old proprietor or proprietors to one or more persons none of whom was an old proprietor (on the ground that the patent was granted to a person not entitled to be granted the patent), any licences or other rights in or under the patent shall, subject to the provisions of the order and subsection (3), lapse on the registration of that person or those persons as the new proprietor or proprietors of the patent.

(3) Where an order is so made that a patent shall be transferred as mentioned in subsection (2) or that a person other than an old proprietor may make a new application for a patent and before the reference of the question under that section resulting in the making of any such order is registered, the old proprietor or proprietors or a licensee of the patent, acting in good faith, worked the invention in question in Singapore or made effective and serious preparations to do so, the old proprietor or proprietors or the licensee shall, on making a request to the new proprietor or proprietors within the prescribed period, be entitled to be granted a licence (but not an exclusive licence) to continue working or, as the case may be, to work the invention, so far as it is the subject of the new application.

(4) Any such licence shall be granted for a reasonable period and on reasonable terms.

(5) The new proprietor or proprietors of the patent or any person claiming that he is entitled to be granted any such licence may refer to the Registrar the question whether that person is so entitled and whether any such period is or terms are reasonable.

(6) The Registrar shall determine the question referred to in subsection (5) and may, if he considers it appropriate, order the grant of such a licence.

## PART IX

Employees’ Inventions

### Right to employees’ inventions

49\.—(1) Notwithstanding anything in any rule of law, an invention made by an employee shall, as between him and his employer, be taken to belong to his employer for the purposes of this Act and all other purposes if —

(a) the invention was made in the course of the normal duties of the employee or in the course of duties falling outside his normal duties, but specifically assigned to him, and the circumstances in either case were such that an invention might reasonably be expected to result from the carrying out of his duties; or

(b) the invention was made in the course of the duties of the employee and, at the time of making the invention, because of the nature of his duties and the particular responsibilities arising from the nature of his duties he had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer’s undertaking.

(2) Any other invention made by an employee shall, as between him and his employer, be taken for those purposes to belong to the employee.

(3) Where by virtue of this section an invention belongs, as between him and his employer, to an employee, nothing done —

(a) by or on behalf of the employee or any person claiming under him for the purposes of pursuing an application for a patent; or

(b) by any person for the purpose of performing or working the invention,

shall be taken to infringe any copyright or design right to which, as between him and his employer, his employer is entitled in any model or document relating to the invention.

(4) In subsection (3), the reference to application for a patent includes an application for other protection for an invention, and includes an application for a patent or any other protection under the law of a country other than Singapore or under any treaty to which Singapore is a party.

### Supplementary provisions

50\.—(1) This Part shall not apply to an invention made by an employee unless at the time he made the invention one of the following conditions was satisfied in his case:

(a) he was mainly employed in Singapore; or

(b) he was not mainly employed anywhere or his place of employment could not be determined, but his employer had a place of business in Singapore to which the employee was attached, whether or not he was also attached elsewhere.

(2) In this Part, except so far as the context otherwise requires, references to the making of an invention by an employee are references to his making it alone or jointly with any other person, but do not include references to his merely contributing advice or other assistance in the making of an invention by another employee.

(3) Any references in section 49 to a patent and to a patent being granted are respectively references to a patent or other protection and to its being granted whether under the law of Singapore or the law in force in any other country or under any treaty or international convention.

(4) Nothing in this Part shall be construed as precluding the operation of an agreement or a contract in relation to the right to an invention.

## PART X

Contracts as to Patented Products

### Avoidance of certain restrictive conditions

51\.—(1) Subject to this section, any condition or term of a contract for the supply of a patented product or of a licence to work a patented invention, or of a contract relating to any such supply or licence, shall be void in so far as it purports —

(a) in the case of a contract for supply, to require the person supplied to acquire from the supplier, or his nominee, or prohibit him from acquiring from any specified person, or from acquiring except from the supplier or his nominee, anything other than the patented product;

(b) in the case of a licence to work a patented invention, to require the licensee to acquire from the licensor or his nominee, or prohibit him from acquiring from any specified person, or from acquiring except from the licensor or his nominee, anything other than the product which is the patented invention or (if it is a process) other than any product obtained directly by means of the process or to which the process has been applied; or

(c) in either case, to prohibit the person supplied or the licensee from using articles (whether patented products or not) which are not supplied by, or any patented process which does not belong to, the supplier or licensor, or his nominee, or to restrict the right of the person supplied or the licensee to use any such articles or process.

(2) In proceedings against any person for infringement of a patent, it shall be a defence to prove that at the time of the infringement there was in force a contract relating to the patent made by or with the consent of the plaintiff or a licence under the patent granted by him or with his consent and containing in either case a condition or term void by virtue of this section.

(3) A condition or term of a contract or licence shall not be void by virtue of this section if —

(a) at the time of the making of the contract or granting of the licence, the supplier or licensor was willing to supply the product, or grant a licence to work the invention, as the case may be, to the person supplied or the licensee, on reasonable terms specified in the contract or licence and without any such condition or term as is mentioned in subsection (1); and

(b) the person supplied or the licensee is entitled under the contract or licence to relieve himself of his liability to observe the condition or term on giving to the other party 3 months’ notice in writing, and subject to payment to that other party of such compensation (being, in the case of a contract to supply, a lump sum or rent for the residue of the term of the contract and, in the case of a licence, a royalty for the residue of the term of the licence) as may be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister.

(4) If in any proceedings it is alleged that any condition or term of a contract or licence is void by virtue of this section, it shall lie on the supplier or licensor to prove the matters set out in subsection (3)(a).

(5) A condition or term of a contract or licence shall not be void by virtue of this section by reason only that it prohibits any person from selling goods other than those supplied by a specific person or, in the case of a contract for the hiring of or licence to use a patented product, that it reserves to the bailor or licensor, or his nominee, the right to supply such new parts of the patented product as may be required to put or keep it in repair.

### Determination of parts of certain contracts

52\.—(1) Any contract for the supply of a patented product or licence to work a patented invention, or contract relating to any such supply or licence, may at any time after the patent or all the patents by which the product or invention was protected at the time of the making of the contract or granting of the licence has or have ceased to be in force, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the contract or licence or in any other contract, be determined, to the extent (and only to the extent) that the contract or licence relates to the product or invention, by either party on giving 3 months’ notice in writing to the other party.

(2) In subsection (1), “patented product” and “patented invention” include respectively a product and an invention which is the subject of an application for a patent, and that subsection shall apply in relation to a patent by which any such product or invention was protected and which was granted after the time of the making of the contract or granting of the licence, on an application which had been filed before that time, as it applies to a patent in force at that time.

(3) If, on an application under this section made by either party to a contract or licence falling within subsection (1), the court is satisfied that, in consequence of the patent or patents ceasing to be in force, it would be unjust to require the applicant to continue to comply with all the terms and conditions of the contract or licence, the court may make such order varying those terms or conditions as, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it thinks just as between the parties.

(4) Without prejudice to any other right of recovery, nothing in subsection (1) shall be taken to entitle any person to recover property let under a hire-purchase agreement within the meaning of the Hire-Purchase Act (Cap. 125).

(5) This section shall be without prejudice to any rule of law relating to the frustration of contracts and any right of determining a contract or licence exercisable apart from this section.

(2) Where an application under subsection (1) is made, the Registrar shall give notice of the application to any person registered as having a right in or under the patent and, if satisfied that the proprietor of the patent is not precluded by contract from granting licences under the patent, the Registrar shall make that entry.

(c) if, in proceedings for infringement of the patent, the defendant undertakes to take a licence on such terms, no injunction shall be granted against him and the amount (if any) recoverable against him by way of damages shall not exceed twice the amount which would have been payable by him as licensee if such a licence on those terms had been granted before the earliest infringement; and

(d) the renewal fee payable in respect of the patent after the date of the entry shall be half the fee which would be payable if the entry had not been made.

(4) An undertaking under subsection (3)(c) may be given at any time before final order in the proceedings, without any admission of liability.

(5) The licensee under a licence of right may (unless, in the case of a licence the terms of which are settled by agreement, the licence otherwise expressly provides) request the proprietor of the patent to take proceedings to prevent any infringement of the patent.

(6) If the proprietor refuses or neglects to take proceedings under subsection (5) within 2 months after being so requested, the licensee may institute proceedings for the infringement in his own name as if he were the proprietor, making the proprietor a defendant.

(3) Within the prescribed period after an entry had been made under section 53 in respect of a patent, any person who claims that the proprietor of the patent is, and was at the time of the entry, precluded by a contract in which the claimant is interested from granting licences under the patent may apply to the Registrar for cancellation of the entry.

(4) Where the Registrar is satisfied, on an application under subsection (3), that the proprietor of the patent is and was so precluded, he shall cancel the entry.

(5) The proprietor shall be liable to pay, within a period specified by the Registrar, a sum equal to the balance of all renewal fees which would have been payable if the entry had not been made, and the patent shall cease to have effect at the expiration of that period if that sum is not so paid.

(6) Where an entry is cancelled under this section, the rights and liabilities of the proprietor of the patent shall after the cancellation be the same as if the entry had not been made.

(7) Where an application has been made under this section —

(2) Where a certificate is granted under this section, then, if in any subsequent proceedings before the court or the Registrar for infringement of the patent or for revocation of the patent, a final order or judgment is made or given in favour of the party relying on the validity of the patent as found in the earlier proceedings, that party shall, unless the court or the Registrar otherwise directs, be entitled to his costs or expenses as between solicitor and own client other than the costs or expenses of any appeal in the subsequent proceedings.

### Proceedings for infringement by co-owner

73\.—(1) In the application of section 66 to a patent of which there are 2 or more joint proprietors, the reference to the proprietor shall be construed —

(a) in relation to any act, as a reference to that proprietor or those proprietors who, by virtue of section 46 or any agreement referred to in that section, is or are entitled to do that act without its amounting to an infringement; and

(b) in relation to any consent, as a reference to that proprietor or those proprietors who, by virtue of section 46 or any such agreement, is or are the proper person or persons to give the requisite consent.

(2) One of 2 or more joint proprietors of a patent may without the concurrence of the others bring proceedings in respect of an act alleged to infringe the patent, but shall not do so unless the others are made parties to the proceedings; but any of the others if made a defendant shall not be liable for any costs or expenses unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings.

(2) In awarding damages or granting any other relief in any such proceedings, the court or the Registrar shall take into consideration any loss suffered or likely to be suffered by the exclusive licensee as such as a result of the infringement, or, as the case may be, the profits derived from the infringement, so far as it constitutes an infringement of the rights of the exclusive licensee as such.

(3) In any proceedings taken by an exclusive licensee by virtue of this section, the proprietor of the patent shall be made a partyto the proceedings, but if made a defendant shall not be liable for any costs or expenses unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings.

76\.—(1) Where an application for a patent for an invention is published, then, subject to this section, the applicant shall have, as from the publication and until the grant of the patent, the same right as he would have had, if the patent had been granted on the date of the publication of the application, to bring proceedings in the court or before the Registrar for damages in respect of any act which would have infringed the patent.

(2) References in sections 66 to 69 and 73 to 75 to a patent and the proprietor of a patent shall be respectively construed as including references to any such application and the applicant, and references to a patent being in force, being granted, being valid or existing shall be construed accordingly.

(3) The applicant shall be entitled to bring proceedings by virtue of this section in respect of any act only —

(a) after the patent has been granted; and

(b) if the act would, if the patent had been granted on the date of the publication of the application, have infringed not only the patent, but also the claims (as interpreted by the description and any drawings referred to in the description or claims) in the form in which they were contained in the application immediately before the preparations for its publication were completed by the Registry.

(4) Section 69(3) and (4) shall not apply to an infringement of the rights conferred by this section but in considering the amount of any damages for such an infringement, the court or the Registrar shall consider whether or not it would have been reasonable to expect, from a consideration of the application as published under section 27, that a patent would be granted conferring on the proprietor of the patent protection from an act of the same description as that found to infringe those rights, and if the court or the Registrar finds that it would not have been reasonable, it or he shall reduce the damages to such an amount as it or he thinks just.

### Remedy for groundless threats of infringement proceedings

77\.—(1) Where a person (whether or not the proprietor of, or entitled to any right in, a patent) by circulars, advertisements or otherwise threatens another person with proceedings for any infringement of a patent, a person aggrieved by the threats (whether or not he is the person to whom the threats are made) may, subject to subsection (4), bring proceedings in the court against the person making the threats, claiming any relief mentioned in subsection (3).

(2) In any such proceedings, the plaintiff shall, if he proves that the threats were so made and satisfies the court that he is a person aggrieved by them, be entitled to the relief claimed unless —

(c) damages in respect of any loss which the plaintiff has sustained by the threats.

(4) Proceedings may not be brought under this section for a threat to bring proceedings for an infringement alleged to consist of making or importing a product for disposal or of using a process.

(5) It is hereby declared that a mere notification of the existence of a patent does not constitute a threat of proceedings within the meaning of this section.

(5) Where the validity of a patent is put in issue by way of defence or counterclaim, the court or the Registrar shall, if it or he thinks it just to do so, give the defendant an opportunity to comply with the condition in subsection (4)(a).

(6) In subsection (4), “entitlement proceedings”, in relation to a patent, means a reference under section 47(1) on the ground that the patent was granted to a person not entitled to it or proceedings for a declaration that it was so granted.

(7) Where proceedings with respect to a patent are pending in the court under any provision of this Act mentioned in subsection (1), no proceedings may be instituted without the leave of the court before the Registrar with respect to that patent under section 67(3), 76, 78 or 80.

(8) It is hereby declared that for the purposes of this Act the validity of a patent is not put in issue merely because the Registrar is considering its validity in order to decide whether to revoke it under section 81.

(3) For the purposes of section 56 (use of invention for service of the Government) and section 76 (infringement of rights conferred by publication) the application, not having been published under this Act, shall be treated as published under section 27 —

### Information about patent applications and patents, and inspection of documents

108\.—(1) After publication of an application for a patent in accordance with section 27, the Registrar shall, on request being made to him in the prescribed manner and on payment of the prescribed fee (if any), give the person making the request such information, and permit him to inspect such documents, relating to the application or to any patent granted in pursuance of the application as may be specified in the request, subject, however, to any prescribed restriction.

(5) Where an application for a patent is filed, but not published, and a new application is filed in respect of any part of the subject-matter of the earlier application (either in accordance with the rules or in pursuance of an order under section 20) and is published, any person may make a request under subsection (1) relating to the earlier application and on payment of the prescribed fee the Registrar shall give him such information and permit him to inspect such documents as could have been given or inspected if the earlier application had been published.

(6) The publication of the whole or part of a specification of a patent or an application for a patent shall not constitute an infringement of any copyright subsisting under the Copyright Act (Cap. 63) in any literary or artistic work.

[3/2001]

(2) The rules may contain such provision as the Minister thinks fit regulating the circumstances in which such an extension may be granted and may also provide for the protection and compensation of persons affected by the grant of extension of time and may authorise the Registrar to grant an extension of time notwithstanding that the period has already expired.

(2) The rules may in particular require the applicant or patentee —

### Transitional provisions

(2) Where a patent has been granted under the United Kingdom Patents Act 1977 not earlier than 36 months before, or not later than 12 months after, 23rd February 1995, the proprietor of the patent may, within a period of 24 months from that date, make an application for a certificate of registration and the Registrar may issue a certificate on such application as if the Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act had not been repealed.

(3) Any certificate of registration issued under section 5 of the Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act and is in force immediately before 23rd February 1995, or issued after that date by virtue of subsection (1) or (2) shall continue in force and the patent to which the certificate relates shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as if it were a patent under this Act granted in pursuance of an application made under this Act and the proprietor of the patent shall accordingly have the same rights, remedies, privileges and obligations and subject to the same conditions (including the payment of any fee prescribed under section 36), as the proprietor of a patent under this Act subject to the following modifications:

(a) the term of the patent shall date from the date of the patent in the United Kingdom and the patent shall subject to this Act remain in force for 20 years from that date and only so long as the patent has not been revoked in the United Kingdom before 17th October 2001;

(b) such other modifications as may be prescribed.

[30/2001]

(6) Where an act is commenced before 23rd February 1995 and continues to be done on or after that date, then, if it would not, under the law in force immediately before that date, amount to an infringement of a patent or the privileges or rights arising under a specification, its continuance on or after that date shall not amount to the infringement of that patent or those privileges or rights.
