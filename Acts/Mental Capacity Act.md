## PART II

PERSONS WHO LACK CAPACITY

### The principles

3\.—(1) The following principles apply for the purposes of this Act.

(2) A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity.

(3) A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success.

(4) A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.

(5) An act done, or a decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests.

(6) Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 1]

### Persons who lack capacity

4\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.

(2) It does not matter whether the impairment or disturbance is permanent or temporary.

(3) A lack of capacity cannot be established merely by reference to —

(a) a person’s age or appearance; or

(b) a condition of his, or an aspect of his behaviour, which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about his capacity.

(4) In proceedings under this Act (other than proceedings for offences under this Act), any question whether a person lacks capacity within the meaning of this Act must be decided on the balance of probabilities.

(5) Subject to section 21, no power which a person (“D”) may exercise under this Act —

(a) in relation to a person who lacks capacity; or

(b) where D reasonably thinks that a person lacks capacity,

is exercisable in relation to a person below 21 years of age.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 2]

### Inability to make decisions

5\.—(1) For the purposes of section 4, a person is unable to make a decision for himself if he is unable —

(a) to understand the information relevant to the decision;

(b) to retain that information;

(c) to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or

(d) to communicate his decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any other means).

(2) A person is not to be regarded as unable to understand the information relevant to a decision if he is able to understand an explanation of it given to him in a way that is appropriate to his circumstances (using simple language, visual aids or any other means).

(3) The fact that a person is able to retain the information relevant to a decision for a short period only does not prevent him from being regarded as able to make the decision.

(4) The information relevant to a decision includes information about the reasonably foreseeable consequences of —

(a) deciding one way or another; or

(b) failing to make the decision.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 3]

### Best interests

6\.—(1) In determining for the purposes of this Act what is in a person’s best interests, the person making the determination must not make it merely on the basis of —

(a) the person’s age or appearance; or

(b) a condition of his, or an aspect of his behaviour, which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about what might be in his best interests.

(2) The person making the determination must consider all the relevant circumstances and, in particular, take the steps specified in subsections (3) to (8).

(3) He must consider —

(a) whether it is likely that the person will at some time have capacity in relation to the matter in question; and

(b) if it appears likely that he will, when that is likely to be.

(4) He must, so far as is reasonably practicable, permit and encourage the person to participate, or to improve his ability to participate, as fully as possible in any act done for him and any decision affecting him.

(5) Where the determination relates to life-sustaining treatment, he must not, in considering whether the treatment is in the best interests of the person concerned, be motivated by a desire to bring about his death.

(6) Where the determination relates to the disposition or settlement of the person’s property, he must be motivated by a desire to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the person’s property is preserved for application towards the costs of the person’s maintenance during his life.

(7) He must consider, so far as is reasonably ascertainable —

(a) the person’s past and present wishes and feelings (and, in particular, any relevant written statement made by him when he had capacity);

(b) the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his decision if he had capacity; and

(c) the other factors that he would be likely to consider if he were able to do so.

(8) He must take into account, if it is practicable and appropriate to consult them, the views of —

(a) anyone named by the person as someone to be consulted on the matter in question or on matters of that kind;

(b) anyone engaged in caring for the person or interested in his welfare;

(c) any donee of a lasting power of attorney granted by the person; and

(d) any deputy appointed for the person by the court,

as to what would be in the person’s best interests and, in particular, as to the matters mentioned in subsection (7).

(9) The duties imposed by subsections (1) to (8) also apply in relation to the exercise of any powers which —

(a) are exercisable under a lasting power of attorney; or

(b) are exercisable by a person under this Act where he reasonably believes that another person lacks capacity.

(10) In the case of an act done, or a decision made, by a person other than the court, there is sufficient compliance with this section if (having complied with the requirements of subsections (1) to (8)) he reasonably believes that what he does or decides is in the best interests of the person concerned.

(11) In subsection (2), “relevant circumstances” are those —

(a) of which the person making the determination is aware; and

(b) which it would be reasonable to regard as relevant.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 4]

## PART III

ACTS IN CONNECTION WITH CARE OR TREATMENT

### Acts in connection with care or treatment

7\.—(1) If a person (“D”) does an act in connection with the care or treatment of another person (“P”), the act is one to which this section applies if —

(a) before doing the act, D takes reasonable steps to establish whether P lacks capacity in relation to the matter in question; and

(b) when doing the act, D reasonably believes —

(i) that P lacks capacity in relation to the matter; and

(ii) that it will be in P’s best interests for the act to be done.

(2) D does not incur any liability in relation to the act that he would not have incurred if P —

(a) had had capacity to consent in relation to the matter; and

(b) had consented to D’s doing the act.

(3) Nothing in this section —

(a) excludes a person’s civil liability for loss or damage, or his criminal liability, resulting from his negligence in doing the act;

(b) affects the operation of the Advance Medical Directive Act (Cap. 4A); or

(c) applies to the conduct of a clinical trial.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 5]

### Section 7 acts: limitations

8\.—(1) If D does an act that is intended to restrain P, it is not an act to which section 7 applies unless 2 further conditions are satisfied.

(2) The first condition is that D reasonably believes that it is necessary to do the act in order to prevent harm to P.

(3) The second condition is that the act is a proportionate response to —

(a) the likelihood of P’s suffering harm; and

(b) the seriousness of that harm.

(4) For the purposes of this section, D restrains P if he —

(a) uses, or threatens to use, force to secure the doing of an act which P resists; or

(b) restricts P’s liberty of movement, whether or not P resists.

(5) Section 7 does not authorise a person to do an act which is inconsistent with a decision made, within the scope of the authority of, and in accordance with this Act, by —

(a) a donee of a lasting power of attorney granted by P; or

(b) a deputy appointed for P by the court.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 6]

### Payment for necessary goods and services

9\.—(1) If necessary goods or services are supplied to a person who lacks capacity to contract for the supply, he must pay a reasonable price for them.

(2) In subsection (1), “necessary” means suitable to a person’s condition in life and to his actual requirements at the time when the goods or services are supplied.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 7]

### Expenditure

10\.—(1) If an act to which section 7 applies involves expenditure for necessary goods or services within the meaning of section 9, it is lawful for D to apply money in P’s actual possession for meeting the expenditure.

(2) If the expenditure is borne for P by D, it is lawful for D —

(a) to reimburse himself out of money in P’s actual possession; or

(b) to be otherwise indemnified by P.

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not affect any power under which (apart from those subsections) a person —

(a) has lawful control of P’s money or other property; and

(b) has power to spend money for P’s benefit.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 8]

## PART IV

LASTING POWERS OF ATTORNEY

### Lasting powers of attorney

11\.—(1) A lasting power of attorney is a power of attorney under which the donor (“P”) confers on the donee (or donees) authority to make decisions about all or any of the following:

(a) P’s personal welfare or specified matters concerning P’s personal welfare;

(b) P’s property and affairs or specified matters concerning P’s property and affairs,

when P no longer has capacity to make such decisions.

(2) A lasting power of attorney is not created unless —

(a) section 12 is complied with;

(b) an instrument conferring authority of the kind mentioned in subsection (1) is made and registered in accordance with the First Schedule; and

(c) at the time when P executes the instrument, P has attained the age of 21 years and has capacity to execute it.

(3) An instrument which —

(a) purports to create a lasting power of attorney; but

(b) does not comply with this section, section 12 or the First Schedule,

confers no authority.

(4) The authority conferred by a lasting power of attorney is subject to —

(a) the provisions of this Act and, in particular, sections 3 (the principles) and 6 (best interests); and

(b) any conditions or restrictions specified in the instrument.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 9]

### Appointment of donees

12\.—(1) A donee of a lasting power of attorney must be —

(a) an individual who has attained the age of 21 years; or

(b) if the power relates only to P’s property and affairs, either such an individual, or a person other than an individual who is within a class of persons prescribed as being eligible to be appointed as donees.

(2) A person who is an undischarged bankrupt may not be appointed as donee of a lasting power of attorney in relation to P’s property and affairs.

(3) Subsections (4) to (7) apply in relation to an instrument under which 2 or more persons are to act as donees of a lasting power of attorney.

(4) The instrument may appoint them to act —

(a) jointly;

(b) jointly and severally; or

(c) jointly in respect of some matters and jointly and severally in respect of others.

(5) To the extent to which it does not specify whether they are to act jointly or jointly and severally, the instrument is to be assumed to appoint them to act jointly.

(6) If they are to act jointly, a failure, as respects one of them, to comply with the requirements of subsection (1) or (2) or Part I or II of the First Schedule prevents a lasting power of attorney from being created.

(7) If they are to act jointly and severally, a failure, as respects one of them, to comply with the requirements of subsection (1) or (2) or Part I or II of the First Schedule —

(a) prevents the appointment taking effect in his case; but

(b) does not prevent a lasting power of attorney from being created in the case of the other or others.

(8) An instrument used to create a lasting power of attorney —

(a) cannot give the donee (or, if more than one, any of them) power to appoint a substitute or successor; but

(b) may itself appoint a person (called in subsection (9) the replacement donee) to replace the donee (or, if more than one, any of them) on the occurrence of an event mentioned in section 15(5)(a) to (d) which has the effect of terminating the donee’s appointment.

[Act 10 of 2016 wef 30/06/2016]

[UK MCA 2005, s. 10]

(9) To avoid doubt, an instrument used to create a lasting power of attorney cannot itself appoint a person to replace the replacement donee.

[Act 10 of 2016 wef 30/06/2016]

### Lasting powers of attorney: restrictions

13\.—(1) A donee under a lasting power of attorney (or, if more than one, any of them) may only make decisions under the lasting power of attorney where P lacks, or the donee reasonably believes that P lacks capacity.

(2) A lasting power of attorney does not authorise the donee (or, if more than one, any of them) to do an act that is intended to restrain P, unless 2 further conditions are satisfied.

(3) The first condition is that the donee reasonably believes that it is necessary to do the act in order to prevent harm to P.

(4) The second condition is that the act is a proportionate response to —

(a) the likelihood of P’s suffering harm; and

(b) the seriousness of that harm.

(5) For the purposes of this section, the donee restrains P if he —

(a) uses, or threatens to use, force to secure the doing of an act which P resists; or

(b) restricts P’s liberty of movement, whether or not P resists,

or if he authorises another person to do any of those things.

(6) Subject to subsection (8), where a lasting power of attorney authorises the donee (or, if more than one, any of them) to make decisions about P’s personal welfare, the authority extends to giving or refusing consent to the carrying out or continuation of a treatment by a person providing health care for P if, and only if, the instrument contains express provision to that effect.

(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), treatment, in relation to P, includes the conduct of a clinical trial on P.

(8) Notwithstanding anything in the lasting power of attorney, a donee authorised to make decisions about P’s personal welfare may not make any decision with respect to the carrying out or continuation of —

(a) life-sustaining treatment on P, whether or not amounting to extraordinary life-sustaining treatment within the meaning of section 2 of the Advance Medical Directive Act (Cap. 4A); or

(b) any other treatment on P which a person providing health care reasonably believes is necessary to prevent a serious deterioration in P’s condition.

(9) Notwithstanding anything in the lasting power of attorney, a donee authorised to make decisions about P’s property and affairs may not —

(a) make, on P’s behalf, any nomination under section 49L(2) or 49M(2) of the Insurance Act (Cap. 142);

(b) where any nomination under section 49L(2) or 49M(2) of the Insurance Act has been made by P or by the court on P’s behalf, revoke, on P’s behalf, that nomination under section 49L(7) or 49M(4), as the case may be, of that Act; or

(c) execute a will for P.

[3/2009]

(9A) Notwithstanding anything in the lasting power of attorney, a donee authorised to make decisions about P’s property and affairs may not —

(a) execute under section 15(6A) or 25(1) of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36), on P’s behalf, any memorandum under section 25(1) of that Act; or

(b) where any such memorandum has been executed, or any nomination has been made under section 25(1) of that Act, by P or by the court on P’s behalf, revoke, on P’s behalf, that memorandum or nomination, as the case may be.

[18/2009]

(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a person dealing with a donee in matters relating to P’s property may require the donee to produce a certificate from a registered medical practitioner stating that P’s lack of capacity is likely to be permanent, and if the donee fails to produce such certificate, the person may refuse to accept the donee’s authority to make decisions for P in such matters.

(11) This section is without prejudice to any other power conferred on a donee of a lasting power of attorney under any other written law.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 11]

### Scope of lasting powers of attorney: gifts

14\.—(1) Where a lasting power of attorney confers authority to make decisions about P’s property and affairs, it does not authorise a donee (or, if more than one, any of them) to dispose of the donor’s property by making gifts except to the extent permitted under subsections (2) and (3).

(2) The donee may make gifts if, and only if, the lasting power of attorney contains express authorisation to that effect.

(3) Where the express authorisation in the lasting power of attorney does not specify the value of the gift or gifts to be made, the donee —

(a) may make a gift or gifts of such value which are not unreasonable having regard to all the circumstances and, in particular, the size of the donor’s estate; and

(b) must have regard to the principle in section 6(6).

(4) Subsection (3) is without prejudice to section 11(4).

### Revocation of lasting powers of attorney, etc.

15\.—(1) This section applies if —

(a) P has executed an instrument with a view to creating a lasting power of attorney; or

(b) a lasting power of attorney is registered as having been conferred by P,

and in this section, references to revoking the power include revoking the instrument.

(2) P may, at any time when he has capacity to do so, revoke the power.

(3) P’s bankruptcy revokes the power so far as it relates to P’s property and affairs.

(4) The occurrence in relation to a donee of an event mentioned in subsection (5) —

(a) terminates his appointment; and

(b) except in the cases given in subsection (6), revokes the power.

(5) The events are —

(a) the disclaimer of the appointment by the donee in accordance with such requirements as may be prescribed for the purposes of this section in regulations made under this Act;

(b) subject to subsection (7), the death or bankruptcy of the donee or, if the donee is a person other than an individual, its liquidation, winding-up, dissolution or being under judicial management;

(c) subject to subsection (8), the dissolution or annulment of a marriage between the donor and the donee;

(d) the lack of capacity of the donee.

(6) The cases referred to in subsection (4)(b) are —

(a) the donee is replaced under the terms of the instrument;

(b) he is one of 2 or more persons appointed to act as donees jointly and severally in respect of any matter and, after the event, there is at least one remaining donee.

(7) The bankruptcy of a donee does not terminate his appointment, or revoke the power, in so far as his authority relates to P’s personal welfare.

(8) The dissolution or annulment of a marriage between the donor and the donee does not terminate the appointment of a donee, or revoke the power, if the instrument provided that it was not to do so.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 13]

### Protection of donees and others if lasting power of attorney not validly created, revoked or suspended, etc.

16\.—(1) This section applies where —

(a) an instrument purporting to create a lasting power of attorney has been registered under the First Schedule, but a lasting power of attorney was not validly created, whether or not the registration is cancelled at the time of the act or transaction in question; or

(b) a lasting power of attorney, or a power under a lasting power of attorney, is revoked or suspended.

(2) A donee who does an act that would have been within the scope of the lasting power of attorney without knowing of the non‑existence, revocation or suspension of the lasting power of attorney or the power under the lasting power of attorney does not incur any liability to P or any other person, despite the non‑existence, revocation or suspension.

(3) If a lasting power of attorney or a power under a lasting power of attorney is non‑existent, revoked or suspended, a person (called in this section a third party) who deals or otherwise transacts in good faith with the donee, without knowing of the non‑existence, revocation or suspension, is entitled to rely on the lasting power of attorney or the power under the lasting power of attorney in relation to that dealing or transaction in the same manner and to the same extent as if the lasting power of attorney or the power under the lasting power of attorney exists or had not been revoked or suspended.

(4) It is conclusively presumed in favour of a purchaser from a third party who dealt or otherwise transacted with a donee that the dealing or transaction was valid if —

(a) the dealing or transaction was completed within 12 months after the date on which the instrument intending to create a lasting power of attorney was registered; or

(b) the third party makes a statutory declaration, before, on or within 3 months after, the completion of the purchase by the purchaser, that the third party had no reason at the time of the dealing or transaction with the donee to doubt the donee’s authority to deal or transact.

(5) In subsection (4), “purchaser” means a person claiming through the third party and who acquires the property in good faith and for valuable consideration.

(6) For the purposes of this section, knowledge that a lasting power of attorney or a power under a lasting power of attorney does not exist or has been revoked or suspended includes knowledge of the happening of any event —

(a) which prevents the lasting power of attorney from being created; or

(b) which has the effect of revoking or suspending the lasting power of attorney or the power under the lasting power of attorney.

(7) In this section, where 2 or more donees are appointed under a lasting power of attorney, a reference to the donee is a reference to all or any of the donees.

(8) This section applies only to acts and transactions made on or after the date of commencement of section 4 of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act 2016, whether the lasting power of attorney or the power under the lasting power of attorney is created or purported to be created, or revoked or suspended, before, on or after that date.

[Act 10 of 2016 wef 30/06/2016]

### Powers of court in relation to validity of lasting powers of attorney

17\.—(1) This section and section 18 apply if —

(a) a person (“P”) has executed or purported to execute an instrument with a view to creating a lasting power of attorney; or

(b) an instrument has been registered as a lasting power of attorney conferred by P.

(2) The court may determine any question relating to —

(a) whether one or more of the requirements for the creation of a lasting power of attorney have been met;

(b) whether the power has been revoked or has otherwise come to an end.

(3) Subsection (4) applies if the court is satisfied —

(a) that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce P —

(i) to execute an instrument for the purpose of creating a lasting power of attorney; or

(ii) to create a lasting power of attorney; or

(b) that the donee (or, if more than one, any of them) of a lasting power of attorney —

(i) has behaved, or is behaving, in a way that contravenes his authority or is not in P’s best interests; or

(ii) proposes to behave in a way that would contravene his authority or would not be in P’s best interests.

(4) The court may —

(a) direct that an instrument purporting to create the lasting power of attorney is not to be registered; or

(b) if P lacks capacity to do so, revoke the instrument or the lasting power of attorney.

(5) If there is more than one donee, the court may under subsection (4)(b) revoke the instrument or the lasting power of attorney so far as it relates to any of them.

(6) In this section, “donee” includes an intended donee.

[UK MCA 2005, s. 22]
