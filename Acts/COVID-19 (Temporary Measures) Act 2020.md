29\.—(1) This section applies in relation to any remission of property tax given by an order made under section 6(8) of the Property Tax Act (Cap. 254) in response to the COVID‑19 epidemic or pandemic, that is prescribed as a remission to which this section applies (called in this section the prescribed remission), and applies whether the order was made before, on or after the date of commencement of this section.

(2) Where any property to which the prescribed remission relates is leased or licensed by the owner of the property (called in this Part the owner), in whole or in part, to a prescribed lessee or a prescribed licensee (called in this Part the tenant) for any part of the period to which the prescribed remission relates, then the owner must pass the benefit of the reduction in property tax on the property (called in this Part the benefit) to the tenant in the amount or to the extent, in the manner, and in or by the time, prescribed; and the tenant is entitled to the same.

(3) Without limiting subsection (2), the manner in which the benefit must be passed may be prescribed as a single method, or a combination of methods, including (but not limited to) the following:

(a) a payment of money, whether as a lump sum or by way of instalments;

(b) an off-set against or a reduction of the whole or any part of any rent or licence fee payable by the tenant to the owner.

(4) The owner must not subject the passing of the benefit to any condition (whether a condition precedent or subsequent), including any change to any term or condition of the lease or licence agreement with the tenant; and any such condition which the owner purports to impose is void.

(5) The owner must keep and retain in safe custody, for a period of 3 years after the end of the period to which the prescribed remission relates, records evidencing compliance by the owner with subsection (2).

(6) If the owner, without reasonable excuse, fails to pass the benefit to the tenant in accordance with subsection (2), or fails to comply with subsection (5), the owner shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

(c) the award of costs and expenses of and incidental to any proceedings before the Panel.

(8) A witness before the Panel is entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if the witness were a witness before a District Court.

(9) An application under this section must be determined, having regard to the nature and complexity of the dispute, as soon as is reasonably practicable.
