(4) Where the application is for the relief mentioned in subsection (1)(b), the judge shall grant an interim injunction restraining the industrial enterprise from transferring or removing its machinery or equipment and issue a notice calling upon the industrial enterprise to show cause on a date to be specified in the notice as to why the management of the industrial enterprise should not be transferred to the Board.

(8) If cause is shown, the judge shall proceed to investigate the claim of the Board and the provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court shall as far as practicable apply to such proceedings.

(9) On an investigation made under subsection (8), the judge shall make an order —

(a) confirming the order of attachment and directing the sale of the attached property;

(10) Unless the Board intimates to the judge that it will not appeal against any order releasing any property from attachment, the order shall not be given effect to until the expiry of the period fixed under subsection (12) within which an appeal may be lodged, or if an appeal is lodged, unless the Court of Appeal otherwise directs, until the appeal is disposed of.

(11) An order of attachment or sale of property under this section shall be carried into effect as far as may be practicable in the manner provided in the Rules of the Supreme Court for the seizure and sale of property in execution of a judgment or order, as if the Board were the judgment creditor.

(12) Any party aggrieved by an order made under subsection (7) or (9) may, within 30 days from the date of the order, appeal to the Court of Appeal, and, upon the appeal, that Court may after hearing the parties make such orders as it thinks proper.
