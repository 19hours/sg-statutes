[11/89]

[11/2008 wef 26/05/2008]

(7) If no cause is shown on or before the date specified in the notice under subsections (4) and (6), the Judge shall immediately make the interim order final and direct the sale of the attached property or transfer the management of the enterprise to the Board or confirm the injunction.

[11/89]

[11/2008 wef 26/05/2008]

(10) When making any order under subsection (9)(c), the Judge may make such further orders as he thinks necessary to protect the interests of the Board, and may apportion the costs of the proceedings in such manner as he thinks fit.

(11) Unless the Board intimates to the Judge that it will not appeal against any order releasing any property from attachment, the order shall not be given effect to until the expiry of the period referred to in subsection (13) within which an appeal may be lodged, or if an appeal is lodged, unless the Court of Appeal otherwise directs, until the appeal is disposed of.

(12) An order of attachment or sale of property under this section shall be carried into effect as far as may be practicable in the manner provided in the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) for the seizure and sale of property in execution of any judgment or order, as if the Board were the judgment creditor.

(13) Any party aggrieved by an order made under subsection (9) or (10) may, within 30 days from the date of the order, appeal to the Court of Appeal, and, upon the appeal, that Court may after hearing the parties make such orders as it thinks proper.
