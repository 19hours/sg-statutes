(6) In any proceedings for an offence under this Act, if a copy of a film or a container of the film is distributed or publicly exhibited with a classification label affixed to it in accordance with subsection (5), the label is sufficient evidence of the fact that the film is a classified film of the classification rating stated on that label unless the contrary is established.

(7) Where the Authority issues a classification certificate for any film, it may, where the Authority considers appropriate, require the person who applied under section 14 for classification or re-classification of the film to deposit with the Authority a copy of the film identical in content to that which was classified, and in the form the Authority specifies —
