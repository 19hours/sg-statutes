(4) Where no party to the proceedings has taken any further step in the proceedings for a period of not less than 2 years after an order staying the proceedings has been made, the court may, on its own motion, make an order discontinuing the proceedings without prejudice to the right of any of the parties to apply for the discontinued proceedings to be reinstated.

(4) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence.

(5) A party shall not be precluded from raising the plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction by the fact that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.

(6) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitration proceedings.

(7) Notwithstanding any delay in raising a plea referred to in subsection (4) or (6), the arbitral tribunal may admit such plea if it considers the delay to be justified in the circumstances.

(8) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in this section either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits.
