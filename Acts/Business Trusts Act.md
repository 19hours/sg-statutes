(2) When a notice referred to in subsection (1) is given, the transferee shall, unless on an application made by a dissenting unitholder within one month from the date on which the notice was given or within 14 days of a statement being supplied to a dissenting unitholder under subsection (3) (whichever is the later) a court thinks fit to order otherwise, be entitled and bound to acquire those units —

(a) on the terms which under the arrangement or contract the units of the approving unitholders are to be transferred to the transferee; or

(b) if the offer contained 2 or more alternative sets of terms, on the terms which were specified in the offer as being applicable to dissenting unitholders.

(3) Where a transferee has given notice to any dissenting unitholder of the subject trust that it desires to acquire his units, the dissenting unitholder shall be entitled to require the transferee by a demand in writing served on the transferee, within one month from the date on which the notice was given, to supply him with a statement in writing of the names and addresses of all other dissenting unitholders as shown in the register of unitholders of the subject trust; and the transferee shall not be entitled or bound to acquire the units of the dissenting unitholders until 14 days after the posting of the statement of such names and addresses to the dissenting unitholder.

(a) the transferee shall within one month from the date of the transfer (unless on a previous transfer pursuant to the arrangement or contract it has already complied with this requirement) give notice of that fact in the prescribed manner to the holders of the remaining units in, or of the remaining units of that class of units in, the subject trust who have not assented to the arrangement or contract; and

(b) any such holder may within 3 months from receiving the notice require the transferee to acquire his units.

(b) on such other terms as are agreed or as the court on the application of either the transferee or the unitholder thinks fit to order.

(a) after the expiration of one month after the date on which the notice has been given;

(b) after 14 days after a statement has been supplied to a dissenting unitholder under subsection (3); or

(c) if an application to the court by the dissenting unitholder is then pending, after that application has been disposed of,

transmit a copy of the notice to the trustee of the subject trust together with an instrument of transfer executed on behalf of the unitholder by any person appointed by the transferee and on its own behalf by the transferee, and pay, allot or transfer to the trustee of the subject trust the amount or other consideration representing the price payable by the transferee for the units which by virtue of this section the transferee is entitled to acquire, and the trustee of the subject trust shall thereupon register the transferee as the holder of those units.

(7) Any sums received by the trustee of the subject trust under this section shall be paid into a separate bank account, and any such sums and any other consideration so received shall be held by that trustee in trust for the several persons who had held the units in respect of which they were respectively received.

(8) Where any consideration other than cash is held in trust by the trustee of the subject trust for any person under this section, the trustee may, after the expiration of 2 years from, and shall, before the expiration of 10 years from, the date on which such consideration was allotted or transferred to him, transfer such consideration to the Official Receiver.

(9) The Official Receiver shall sell or dispose of any consideration so received in such manner as he thinks fit and shall deal with the proceeds of such sale or disposal as if it were moneys paid to him pursuant to section 49.

(d) where the transferee is the trustee of a trust that is not a business trust or a real estate investment trust, by a related corporation of the trustee (being a corporation) or by a nominee of that related corporation,

shall be treated as held or acquired by the transferee.

(11) For the avoidance of doubt, in this section —

(a) a reference to a transferee (being the trustee of a trust) holding, acquiring or contracting to acquire units in another trust is a reference to his doing any of these as trustee of the first-mentioned trust; and

(b) excludes units which are the subject of a contract binding the holder thereof to accept the offer when it is made, being a contract entered into by the holder for no consideration and under seal or for no consideration other than a promise by the transferee to make the offer.

(13) Where, during the period within which an offer for the transfer of units to the transferee can be approved, the transferee acquires or contracts to acquire any of the units whose transfer is involved but otherwise than by virtue of the approval of the offer, then the transferee may be treated for the purposes of this section as having acquired or contracted to acquire those units by virtue of the approval of the offer if, and only if —

(a) the consideration for which the units are acquired or contracted to be acquired (referred to in this subsection as the acquisition consideration) does not at that time exceed the consideration specified in the terms of the offer; or

(b) those terms are subsequently revised so that when the revision is announced the acquisition consideration, at the time referred to in paragraph (a), no longer exceeds the consideration specified in those terms.

(14) In this section —

“dissenting unitholder” includes a unitholder who has not assented to the arrangement or contract and any unitholder who has failed or refused to transfer his units to the transferee in accordance with the arrangement or contract;

(f) provide that the costs and expenses of and incidental to the application for the order are to be raised and paid out of the trust property of the registered business trust or to be borne and paid in such manner and by such persons as the court deems fit.

(3) Where an order under this section makes any alteration in or addition to the trust deed of any registered business trust, then, notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Act but subject to the provisions of the order, the trustee-manager of the registered business trust concerned shall not have power, without the leave of the court, to make any further alteration in or addition to the trust deed that is inconsistent with the provisions of the order; but subject to the foregoing provisions of this subsection the alterations or additions made by the order shall have the same effect as if duly made by special resolution of the unitholders of the registered business trust.

(4) A copy of any order made under this section shall be lodged by the applicant with the Authority within 7 days after the making of the order.

(5) Any person who contravenes subsection (4) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $1,000 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.

(6) This section shall apply to a person who is not a unitholder of a registered business trust but to whom units in the registered business trust have been transmitted by operation of law as it applies to the unitholders of a registered business trust; and references to a unitholder or unitholders shall be construed accordingly.
