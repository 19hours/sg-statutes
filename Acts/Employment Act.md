(1A) If, after hearing the evidence of the employer or person liable, the Magistrate’s Court adjudicates that such bonds shall be given, the Court may order the employer or person liable to give security by bond in a reasonable sum that he will not leave Singapore until the Court is satisfied that all the just claims against him of his employees for salary or of any subcontractor for labour for money due in respect of any labour provided by him have been paid or settled.

(4) The bond to be given by an employer or person liable shall be a personal bond with one or more sureties, and the penalty for breach of the bond shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and the means of the employer or person liable.

(5) If, on or after a complaint by any employee or subcontractor for labour under subsection (1), it appears to the Magistrate’s Court that there is good ground for believing that the person complained against has absconded or is absconding or is about to abscond, the Court may issue a warrant for the apprehension of that person and that person shall be detained in safe custody pending the hearing of the complaint unless he finds good and sufficient security to the satisfaction of the Court for his appearance to answer the complaint.

(6) If, after summoning any person to show cause why he should not be required to give security by bond to remain in Singapore until the salary of his employees or money due to a subcontractor for labour in respect of any labour provided by him is paid, it appears to the Magistrate’s Court after inquiry has been made by the Commissioner that the employee or subcontractor for labour who made the complaint had no reasonable or sufficient grounds for making it, the Court may impose a fine of $25 upon the employee or subcontractor for labour and in default of payment sentence him to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 days.

(7) For the purposes of this section, a certificate from the Commissioner issued to the Magistrate’s Court to the effect that all salary or money claimed has been paid or settled shall be sufficient evidence of the payment or settlement thereof.

[32/2008 wef 01/01/2009]
