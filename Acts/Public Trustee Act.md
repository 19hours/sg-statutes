In the Administration of Small Estates

### Administration of small estates

6\.—(1) Any person who in the opinion of the Public Trustee would be entitled to apply to the court for an order for the administration by the court of an estate, the gross capital value whereof is proved to the satisfaction of the Public Trustee to be less than $5,000, may apply to the Public Trustee to administer the estate, and where any such application is made, and it appears to the Public Trustee that the persons beneficially entitled are persons of small means, the Public Trustee shall administer the estate, unless he sees good reason for refusing to do so.

### Vesting of trust property

(2) On the Public Trustee undertaking, by declaration in writing signed and sealed by him, to administer the estate, the trust property other than stock shall, by virtue of this Act, vest in him, and the right to transfer or call for the transfer of any stock forming part of the estate shall also vest in him, in like manner as if vesting orders had been made for the purpose by the court under the Trustees Act (Cap. 337), and that Act shall apply accordingly:

Provided that the Public Trustee shall not exercise the right of himself transferring the stock without the leave of the court.

(3) As from such vesting any trustee entitled under the trust to administer the estate shall be discharged from all liability attaching to the administration, except in respect of past acts.

### Administrative powers

(4) For the purposes of the administration the Public Trustee may exercise such of the administrative powers and authorities of the court as are conferred on him by rules made under this Act, subject to such conditions as are imposed by the rules.

### Rules

(5) Rules shall be made under this Act for enabling the Public Trustee to take the opinion of the court on any question arising in the course of any administration without judicial proceedings, and otherwise for making the procedure under this section simple and inexpensive.

### Estate ordered by court to be administered by Public Trustee

(6) Where proceedings have been instituted in any court for the administration of an estate, and by reason of the small value of the estate it appears to the court that the estate can be more economically administered by the Public Trustee than by the court, or that for any other reason it is expedient that the estate should be administered by the Public Trustee instead of the court, the court may order that the estate shall be administered by the Public Trustee, and thereupon, subject to any directions by the court, this section shall apply as if the administration of the estate had been undertaken by the Public Trustee in pursuance of this section.

(7) Where any trust money which is not included in the investment account of the common fund is normally insufficient to earn bank interest if kept in a bank current account the money may be kept in a general banking account or deposited in any bank and any interest allowed by the bank shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.

As an Ordinary Trustee

### Appointment of Public Trustee to be trustee, executor, etc.

7\.—(1) The Public Trustee may by that name, or any other sufficient description, be appointed to be trustee of any will or settlement or other instrument creating a trust or to perform any trust or duty belonging to a class which he is authorised by rules made under this Act to accept, and may be so appointed whether the will or settlement or instrument creating the trust or duty was made or came into operation before or after 27th May 1915 and either as an original or as a new trustee, or as an additional trustee, in the same cases, and in the same manner, and by the same persons or court, as if he was a private trustee, with this addition, that, though the trustees originally appointed were two or more, the Public Trustee may be appointed sole trustee.

### Retirement

(2) Where the Public Trustee has been appointed a trustee of any trust, a co-trustee may retire from the trust under and in accordance with section 43 of the Trustees Act (Cap. 337), notwithstanding that there are not more than two trustees, and without such consents as are required by that section.

### Contrary provisions in trust instrument

(3) The Public Trustee shall not be so appointed either as a new or additional trustee where the will, settlement or other instrument creating the trust or duty contains a direction to the contrary, unless the court otherwise orders.

### Notice to beneficiaries

(4) Notice of any proposed appointment of the Public Trustee, either as a new or additional trustee, shall, where practicable, be given in the prescribed manner to all persons beneficially interested who are resident in Singapore and whose addresses are known to the persons proposing to make the appointment, or, if the beneficiaries are infants, to their guardians.

(5) If any person to whom such notice has been given within 21 days from the receipt of the notice applies to the court, the court may, if having regard to the interests of all the beneficiaries it considers it expedient to do so, make an order prohibiting the appointment being made:

Provided that a failure to give any such notice shall not invalidate any appointment made under this section.

### Granting probate to Public Trustee

8\.—(1) If, in pursuance of any rule under this Act, the Public Trustee is authorised to accept by that name probates of wills or letters of administration, the court having jurisdiction to grant probate of a will or letters of administration may grant such probate or letters to the Public Trustee by that name.

(2) For such purpose the court shall consider the Public Trustee as in law entitled equally with any other person or class of persons to obtain the grant of letters of administration save that the consent or citation of the Public Trustee shall not be required for the grant of letters of administration to any other person, and that, as between the Public Trustee and the widower, widow or next of kin of the deceased, the widower, widow or next of kin shall be preferred, unless for good cause shown to the contrary.

### Transfer by executor after probate to Public Trustee

(3) Any executor who has obtained probate or any administrator who has obtained letters of administration, and notwithstanding he has acted in the administration of the deceased’s estate, may, with the sanction of the court, and after such notice to the persons beneficially interested as the court directs, transfer the estate to the Public Trustee for administration either solely or jointly with the continuing executors or administrators, if any.

(4) The order of the court sanctioning such transfer shall, subject to this Act, give to the Public Trustee all the powers of such executor and administrator.

(5) Such executor and administrator shall not be in any way liable in respect of any act or default in reference to such estate subsequent to the date of such order, other than the act or default of himself or of persons other than himself for whose conduct he is in law responsible.

### Appointment by court of Public Trustee in place of executor or administrator

9\. The court may, on the application of any person beneficially interested, appoint the Public Trustee, if sufficient cause is shown, in place of all or any existing executors or administrators.

Common Fund
