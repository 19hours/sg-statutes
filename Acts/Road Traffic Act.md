### Classification of motor vehicles

4\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, motor vehicles shall be divided into the following classes:

(a) heavy locomotives; that is to say, motor vehicles which are not constructed themselves to carry any load (other than water, fuel, accumulators and other equipment and materials used for the purpose of propulsion, loose tools and loose equipment) and the weight of which unladen exceeds 11,500 kilograms;

(e) motor cars; that is to say, motor vehicles (not being vehicles classified under this section as motor cycles) which are constructed themselves to carry a load or passengers and the weight of which unladen —
