## PART I

REGISTRATION AND LICENSING OF VEHICLES

### Vehicles to which this Part applies

3\. Subject to section 33, this Part shall apply to all vehicles and trailers.

### Classification of motor vehicles

4\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act and the rules, motor vehicles shall be divided into the following classes:

(a) heavy locomotives; that is to say, motor vehicles which are not constructed themselves to carry any load (other than water, fuel, accumulators and other equipment and materials used for the purpose of propulsion, loose tools and loose equipment) and the weight of which unladen exceeds 11,500 kilograms;

(b) light locomotives; that is to say, motor vehicles which are not constructed themselves to carry any load (other than any of the articles specified in paragraph (a)) and the weight of which unladen does not exceed 11,500 kilograms but exceeds 7,250 kilograms;

(c) motor tractors; that is to say, motor vehicles which are not constructed themselves to carry any load (other than any of the articles specified in paragraph (a)) and the weight of which unladen does not exceed 7,250 kilograms;

(d) heavy motor cars; that is to say, motor vehicles (not being vehicles classified under this section as motor cars) which are constructed themselves to carry a load or passengers and the weight of which unladen exceeds 2,500 kilograms;

(e) motor cars; that is to say, motor vehicles (not being vehicles classified under this section as motor cycles) which are constructed themselves to carry a load or passengers and the weight of which unladen —

(i) does not exceed 3,000 kilograms in the case of motor vehicles which are —

(A) constructed solely for the carriage of passengers and their effects;

(B) adapted to carry not more than 7 passengers exclusive of the driver; and

(C) fitted with tyres of the prescribed type; and

(ii) in any other case does not exceed 2,500 kilograms;

(g) invalid carriages; that is to say, motor vehicles the weight of which unladen does not exceed 250 kilograms and which are specially designed and constructed and not merely adapted for the use of persons suffering from some physical defect or disability and are used solely by such persons.

(2) The Authority may make rules for subdividing any such class as aforesaid whether according to weight, construction, nature of tyres, use or otherwise and making different provision with respect to each subdivision and varying in respect of any class the maximum or minimum weight fixed by this section.

[28/95]

(3) Any reference in this Part to a class of motor vehicles shall include a reference to any subdivision of such a class.

(4) For the purposes of this Part —

(a) in any case where a motor vehicle is so constructed that a trailer may by partial superimposition be attached to the vehicle in such manner as to cause a substantial part of the weight of the trailer to be borne by the vehicle, that vehicle shall be deemed to be a vehicle itself constructed to carry a load;

(b) in the case of a motor vehicle fitted with a crane, dynamo, welding plant or other special appliance or apparatus which is a permanent or essentially permanent fixture, the appliance or apparatus shall not be deemed to constitute a load but shall be deemed to form part of the vehicle; and

(c) a side-car attached to a motor cycle shall, if it complies with the prescribed conditions, be regarded as forming part of the vehicle to which it is attached and not as being a trailer.

### Prohibition of vehicles not complying with rules as to construction, etc.

5\.—(1) Subject to this Act, it shall not be lawful to use a vehicle or trailer which does not comply with the rules as to construction, weight and equipment applicable to the class or description of vehicles to which the vehicle or trailer belongs.

[28/95]

(1A) The Authority may, by notification in theGazette, authorise, subject to such restrictions and conditions as may be specified in the notification, the use of special vehicles or trailers or special types of vehicles or trailers which are constructed either for special purposes or for tests or trials and of new or improved types of vehicles or trailers whether wheeled or wheel-less.

[28/95]

(2) The Authority may at any time revoke, vary or amend a notification made under this section.

[28/95]

(3) Subject to this section, it shall not be lawful to sell or to supply or to offer to sell or supply a vehicle or trailer for delivery in such a condition that the use thereof in that condition would be unlawful by virtue of this section.

(4) Subject to this section, it shall not be lawful to alter a vehicle or trailer so as to render its condition such that the use thereof in that condition would be unlawful by virtue of this section.

(5) If a vehicle or trailer is used or is sold, supplied, offered or altered in contravention of this section, any person who so uses the vehicle or trailer or causes or permits the vehicle or trailer to be so used or so sells, supplies, offers or alters it or causes or permits it to be so sold, supplied, offered or altered shall be guilty of an offence.

(6) A person shall not be convicted for an offence under this section in respect of the sale, supply, offer or alteration of a vehicle or trailer if he proves that it was sold, supplied, offered or altered, as the case may be, for export from Singapore, or that he had reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle or trailer would not be used in Singapore or would not be so used until it had been put into a condition in which it might lawfully be so used.

### Rules as to use and construction of vehicles

6\.—(1) The Authority may make rules generally as to the use of vehicles and trailers, their construction and equipment and the conditions under which they may be used and, in particular, may make rules —
