(4) For the purposes of subsection (2), “use of a geographical indication” includes the use of a trade mark which contains or consists of the geographical indication in question.

(5) Subsection (2)(c) and (d) shall not apply to the use of a geographical indication to identify an ingredient of a wine and an ingredient of a spirit, respectively, if the geographical indication is literally true as to the geographical origin of the ingredient in question, provided that such use does not falsely represent to the public that the wine or spirit (as the case may be) originates in the place indicated by the geographical indication.

(6) This section shall apply to any use of a registered geographical indication which identifies any agricultural product or foodstuff (other than a wine or a spirit) belonging to a category of goods listed in the Schedule, in relation to any goods which are of the same category as that agricultural product or foodstuff, but which did not originate in the place indicated by the registered geographical indication, whether or not —

(7) Any use of a registered geographical indication within the meaning of subsection (6) shall be deemed to be an act to which this section applies, even if the geographical indication is literally true as to the geographical origin of the goods in question, provided that such use falsely represents to the public that the goods originate in another place.

### Remedies

5\. Subject to the provisions of this Act, if it is established to the satisfaction of the Court that the defendant to an action brought under section 4 has carried out or is carrying out an act to which that section applies, the Court may grant to the plaintiff one or both of the following:

(b) damages or an account of profits.

### Order for delivery up of goods, material and articles

(b) material —

(i) which bears an indication identical with or similar to the geographical indication;

(ii) which is used by the defendant for labelling or packaging goods, or as a business paper, or for advertising goods; and

(iii) in respect of which the defendant has been found to be carrying out or to have carried out, in relation to the geographical indication, an act to which section 4 applies;

(c) articles —

(i) used by the defendant to make upon material referred to in paragraph (b), copies of an indication identical with or similar to the geographical indication; or

(ii) which the defendant has in his possession, custody or control, knowing or having reason to believe that they have been, or are to be, used to make upon material referred to in paragraph (b), copies of an indication identical with or similar to the geographical indication.

(2) No order shall be made under this section unless the Court also makes, or it appears to the Court that there are grounds for making, an order under section 7.

(3) A person to whom any goods, material or articles are delivered up pursuant to an order under this section shall, if an order under section 7 is not made, retain them pending the making of an order under that section, or until the decision not to make such order.

### Order as to disposal of goods, material or articles

7\.—(1) Where any goods, material or articles have been delivered up pursuant to an order under section 6, an application may be made to the Court —

(a) for an order that they be destroyed or forfeited to such person as the Court may think fit; or

(b) for a decision that no such order should be made.

(2) In considering what order, if any, should be made, the Court shall have regard to —

(b) the need to ensure that no goods, material or articles are disposed of in a manner that would adversely affect the plaintiff.

(3) The Court shall issue directions as to the service of notice on persons having an interest in the goods, material or articles.

(4) Any person having an interest in the goods, material or articles is entitled —

(a) to appear in proceedings for an order under this section, whether or not that person is served with notice under subsection (3); and

(b) to appeal against any order made, whether or not that person appears in the proceedings for that order.

(5) An order made under this section shall not take effect until the end of the period within which notice of an appeal may be given or, if before the end of that period notice of appeal is duly given, until the final determination or abandonment of the proceedings on the appeal.

(6) Where there is more than one person interested in the goods, material or articles, the Court may direct that the goods, material or articles be sold, or otherwise dealt with, and the proceeds divided, and shall make any other order as it thinks just.

(7) If the Court decides that no order should be made under this section, the person in whose possession, custody or control the goods, material or articles were before being delivered up, is entitled to their return.

### Remedy for groundless threats of proceedings under section 4

8\.—(1) Where a person threatens another with proceedings for an action for carrying out an act to which section 4 applies, other than —

(a) the application of a geographical indication in relation to goods or to material used or intended to be used for labelling or packaging goods; or

(b) the importation of goods to which, or to the packaging of which, the geographical indication has been used,

any aggrieved person may bring proceedings for relief under this section.

(2) The relief which may be applied for is any of the following:

(a) a declaration that the threats are unjustifiable;

(b) an injunction against the continuance of the threats;

(c) damages in respect of any loss an aggrieved person has sustained by the threats.

(3) A plaintiff to an action under this section is entitled to the relief referred to in subsection (2) unless the defendant shows that the act in respect of which proceedings were threatened constitutes (or if done would constitute) an act to which section 4 applies.

(4) If the defendant to an action under this section shows that the act in respect of which proceedings were threatened constitutes (or if done would constitute) an act to which section 4 applies, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to relief if he shows that an exception under this Act applies to the act concerned.

(5) The mere notification that a geographical indication is registered, or that an application for registration has been made, does not constitute a threat of proceedings for the purposes of this section.

(6) Nothing in this section shall render an advocate and solicitor liable to an action under this section in respect of an act done by him in his professional capacity on behalf of a client.

### Declaration by Court

9\. Without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the Court to make a declaration apart from this section, the Court may, in proceedings between a person carrying out or proposing to carry out an act and any interested party of goods identified by a geographical indication, make a declaration that section 4 does not apply to that act or proposed act, notwithstanding that no assertion to the contrary has been made by that interested party or any other interested party of goods identified by the geographical indication.

### Homonymous geographical indications for prescribed goods

10\.—(1) Any interested party of any prescribed goods identified by homonymous geographical indications may take action under section 4 against the carrying out of an act to which that section applies.

(2) Any interested party of any prescribed goods identified by homonymous geographical indications may, where no practical conditions in respect of the homonymous geographical indications have been imposed by the Registrar under section 42(2), apply to the Court for a declaration of the practical conditions under which the homonymous geographical indications are to be differentiated from one another.

(3) The Court shall, in making a declaration under subsection (2), take into account —
