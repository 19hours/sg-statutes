(a) any chattel in Singapore; and

(5) In any case in which the chattel requisitioned is a chattel other than a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, such chattel shall, as soon as possession thereof is taken in pursuance of this section, vest in the Government free from any mortgage, pledge, lien or other similar obligation.

On any refusal or neglect to furnish such chattel in the manner aforesaid, or if the competent authority has reasonable ground for believing that it is not practicable without undue delay to give any direction for the chattel requisitioned to be furnished or delivered to the competent authority, then the competent authority or any authorised officer acting on behalf of the competent authority may take possession (and if need be may enter any premises by force for the purpose) of the chattel requisitioned and may use the chattel in like manner as if it had been furnished in pursuance of the requisition. Payment for the chattel shall nevertheless be made in like manner as if the chattel had been duly furnished according to the requisition provided that the chattel specified in the requisition shall not be deemed to have been furnished except in so far as possession is taken by or by the direction of the competent authority.

(8) A competent authority may, to such extent and subject to such restrictions as he thinks proper, delegate all or any of his functions under subsections (1) and (2) to any persons or class of persons specified by the competent authority.

(9) The Commissioner of Police shall, on a request to that effect made by or on behalf of the authorised officer to whom an order is issued to requisition chattels, give instructions for securing that so far as practicable police officers will be available, if required, for accompanying authorised officers requisitioning chattels in pursuance of the order.

(2) Where, in respect of any ship or aircraft, there subsists between a person to whom this section applies and any other person a charter-party or other contract under which the first-mentioned person is entitled to possession of the ship or aircraft, or has the right to have any articles carried in the ship or aircraft or to use any space or accommodation in the ship or aircraft, the competent authority may serve on the first-mentioned person, in any manner appearing to the competent authority to be convenient, a notice stating that on such date as may be specified in the notice his rights and liabilities under the contract will be transferred to the competent authority; and in that event the contract shall, as regards any rights exercisable, or liabilities incurred on or after that date, have effect (subject to subsection (4)) as if the competent authority were a party to the contract instead of the person on whom the notice was served, and as if for any reference in the contract to that person there were substituted a reference to the competent authority.

(3) The persons to whom subsection (2) applies are —

(a) every citizen of Singapore; and

(b) every corporation incorporated in Singapore.

(4) The competent authority may at any time cancel a notice served under subsection (2) in respect of a contract, and thereupon that subsection shall, unless a further notice is served thereunder in respect of that contract, cease to operate in relation to the contract as regards any rights exercisable, or liabilities incurred, on or after the date on which the cancellation takes effect.

(a) a sum equal to the rent which might reasonably be expected to be payable by a tenant in occupation of the land, during the period for which possession of the land is retained or during the period the land is used or occupied in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Act, under a lease granted immediately before the beginning of that period, whereby the landlord undertook to pay all property tax and to bear the cost of the repairs and insurance and the other expenses, if any, necessary to maintain the land in a state to command that rent;

(b) a sum equal to the cost of making good any damage to the land which may have occurred during the period for which possession thereof is so retained or during the period the land is used or occupied (except in so far as the damage has been made good during that period by a person acting on behalf of the Government), no account being taken of fair wear and tear or damage caused by disaster or war operations; and

(c) a sum equal to the amount of any expenses reasonably incurred, otherwise than on behalf of the Government, for the purpose of compliance with any directions given on behalf of the Government in connection with the taking possession of or the use or occupation of the land:

Provided that —

(i) in computing for the purposes of paragraph (a) the rent which might reasonably be expected to be payable in respect of any land, and in computing for the purposes of paragraph (c) any amount which might reasonably have been expected to be payable in addition to rent by an incoming tenant, no account shall be taken of any appreciation of values due to the exercise of the powers under this Act; and

(ii) there shall not, by virtue of paragraph (b), be payable in respect of damage to any land a sum greater than the value of the land at the time when possession, use or occupation thereof was taken in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Act, no account being taken of any appreciation in the value thereof due to the events which led to the exercise of those powers.

(2) Any compensation under subsection (1)(a) shall be considered as accruing due from day to day during the period for which the possession of the land is taken or the land is used or occupied in the exercise of the powers under this Act, and be apportionable in respect of time accordingly, and shall be paid to the person who for the time being would be entitled to occupy the land but for the fact that possession thereof is retained or the land is used or occupied in the exercise of such powers; but this subsection shall not operate so as to require the making of payments at intervals of less than 3 months.

(3) Any compensation under subsection (1)(b) shall accrue due at the end of the period for which possession of the land is retained or the land is used or occupied in the exercise of the powers under this Act and shall be paid to the person who is then the owner of the land.

(4) Any compensation under subsection (1)(c) shall accrue due at the time when possession of the land is taken or the land is used or occupied in the exercise of the powers under this Act, and shall be paid to the person who, immediately before that time, was the occupier of the land.
