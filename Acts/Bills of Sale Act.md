(e) bills of sale of goods in foreign parts or at sea;

(f) bills of lading, warehouse-keeper’s certificates, warrants or orders for the delivery of goods, or any other documents used in the ordinary course of business as proof of the possession or control of goods, or authorising or purporting to authorise, either by endorsement or by delivery, the possessor of such documents to transfer or receive goods thereby represented;

“bill of sale” also includes as regards any personal chattels which may be seized or taken thereunder every attornment, instrument or agreement whereby a power of distress is given or agreed to be given by any person to any other person by way of security for any debt or advance, and whereby any rent is reserved or made payable as a mode of providing for the payment of interest on such debt or advance or otherwise for the purpose of such security only, but does not include or extend to any mortgage of any estate or interest in any land, tenement or hereditament which the mortgagee being in possession demises to the mortgagor as his tenant at a fair and reasonable rent;

“bill of sale” also includes agreements for the hire of personal chattels entered into for the purpose of securing the repayment to the lessor of such chattels of money advanced by him to the hirer; and the hirer shall in every such case be deemed to be the grantor of the bill of sale and the lessor shall be deemed to be the grantee thereof;

(a) the making of any article or part of an article;

(b) the altering, repairing, ornamenting or finishing of any article; or

(c) the adapting for sale of any article;

“personal chattels” means goods, furniture and other articles capable of complete transfer by delivery, and trade machinery as hereinafter defined, and, when separately assigned or charged, fixtures and growing crops; but does not include chattel interests in real estate nor fixtures, except trade machinery as hereinafter defined, when assigned together with a freehold or leasehold interest in any land or building to which they are affixed, nor growing crops when assigned together with any interest in the land on which they grow, nor shares or interests in the stocks, funds or securities of any government or in the capital or property of incorporated or joint-stock companies nor choses in action;

(c) the pipes for steam, gas and water in the factory or workshop.

(2) No fixtures or growing crops shall be deemed to be separately assigned or charged by reason only that they are assigned by separate words, or that power is given to sever them from the land or building to which they are affixed, or from the land on which they grow, without otherwise taking possession of or dealing with such land or building, or land, if by the same instrument any freehold or leasehold interest in the land or building to which such fixtures are affixed, or in the land on which such crops grow, is also conveyed to the same person or persons.

### Bill of sale to be void under certain circumstances unless attested and registered

4\.—(1) Every bill of sale shall be duly attested and shall be registered under this Act within 3 clear days after the execution thereof, and shall truly set out the consideration for which it was given, otherwise the following consequences shall ensue:

(a) in the case of a bill of sale made or given by way of security for the payment of money by the grantor thereof, such bill of sale shall be void in respect of the personal chattels comprised therein;

(b) in the case of any other bill of sale it shall, as against all trustees or assignees of the estate of the person whose chattels or any of them are comprised in such bill of sale under the law of bankruptcy or liquidation or under any assignment for the benefit of the creditors of such person, and also as against all sheriff’s officers and other persons seizing any chattels comprised in that bill of sale in the execution of any process of any court authorising the seizure of the chattels of the person by whom or of whose chattels that bill has been made, and also as against every person on whose behalf such process shall have been issued, be deemed fraudulent and void so far as regards the property in or right to the possession of any chattels comprised in that bill of sale which at or after the time of filing the application for bankruptcy or liquidation or of the execution of such assignment or of executing such process, as the case may be, and after the expiration of such 3 days are in the possession or apparent possession of the person making that bill of sale or of any person against whom the process has issued under or in the execution of which that bill has been made or given, as the case may be.

[42/2005]

(2) Personal chattels shall be deemed to be in the apparent possession of the person making or giving a bill of sale so long as they remain or are in or upon any house, warehouse, shop, building, vessel, works, yard, land or other premises occupied by him, or are used and enjoyed by him in any place whatsoever, notwithstanding that formal possession thereof may have been taken or given by or to any other person.

(3) Personal chattels comprised in a valid bill of sale which is duly attested and registered under this Act shall not, so long as such bill of sale continues to be duly registered under this Act, be deemed to be in the possession, order or disposition of the grantor of the bill of sale within the meaning of the law of bankruptcy.

(4) Subsection (3) shall not apply to personal chattels in the possession, order or disposition of the grantor in his trade or business.

### Bill of sale to be accompanied by schedule of property

5\.—(1) Every bill of sale shall have annexed thereto or written thereon a schedule containing an inventory of the personal chattels comprised in the bill of sale, and such bill of sale, except as hereinafter mentioned, shall have effect only in respect of the personal chattels specifically described in that schedule and shall be void in respect of any personal chattels not so specifically described.

(2) Subject to this Act every bill of sale shall be void in respect of any personal chattels specifically described in the schedule thereto of which the grantor was not the true owner at the time of the execution of the bill of sale.

(a) any growing crops separately assigned or charged where such crops were actually growing at the time when the bill of sale was executed;

(b) any fixtures separately assigned or charged and any plant or trade machinery where such fixtures, plant or trade machinery are used in, attached to, or brought upon any land, plantation, factory, workshop, warehouse or other place in substitution for any of the like fixtures, plant or trade machinery specifically described in the schedule to such bill of sale.

### Bill of sale given by way of security void in certain cases

6\. Subject and without prejudice to the other provisions of this Act for invalidating bills of sale, every bill of sale made or given by way of security for the payment of money by the grantor thereof shall be void in the following cases:

(a) if the amount the payment of which is thereby secured is less than $100;

(b) if it is not made in the form set out in the First Schedule;

(c) if it is made or given wholly or in part in consideration of a pre-existing debt.

### Bill of sale not to protect chattels against rent or property tax

7\. A bill of sale made or given by way of security for the payment of money by the grantor thereof shall be no protection against a distress for the recovery of rent or property tax.

### Possession to be taken under bill of sale under certain circumstances only

8\.—(1) Personal chattels included in a bill of sale made or given by way of security for the payment of money by the grantor thereof shall not be liable to be seized or taken possession of by the grantee for any other than the following causes:

(b) if the grantor becomes a bankrupt or suffers the chattels or any of them to be distrained for rent, property tax or otherwise;

(c) if the grantor fraudulently either removes or suffers to be removed from the premises the chattels or any of them;

(d) if the grantor does not without reasonable excuse upon demand in writing by the grantee produce to him his last receipts for rent and property tax;

(e) if execution has been levied against the goods of the grantor under process of any court.

(2) All personal chattels seized or taken possession of under or by virtue of any bill of sale shall remain on the premises where they were so seized or taken possession of, and shall not be removed or sold until after the expiration of 5 clear days from the day on which they were so seized or taken possession of.

(3) The grantor may within 5 days from the seizure or taking possession of any chattels on account of any of the abovementioned causes, apply to the High Court, and the Court, if satisfied that by payment of money or otherwise the said cause of seizure no longer exists, may restrain the grantee from removing or selling the chattels and may make such other order as seems just.
