### Saving

## PART IV

MISCELLANEOUS

### Minister may appoint boards and committees

24\.—(1) The Minister may appoint such boards or committees as he may think fit for the purpose of assisting him in carrying into effect this Act and may delegate to them such of his powers (other than those conferred by section 6) and may require them to perform such of his duties as he may think necessary.

(2) No delegation under subsection (1) shall be deemed to divest the Minister of any of his powers or duties and he may, if he thinks fit, exercise those powers and perform those duties notwithstanding any such delegation.

### Burden of proof

25\. In any prosecution in respect of an offence under this Act upon a charge of doing any act which is unlawful unless the person doing the act is entitled to do so by reason of his being the holder of a licence, permit or written permission, consent, authorisation or exemption entitling him to do that act, it shall be sufficient for the prosecution to allege and prove his doing that act and the onus shall then be upon the accused to show that he was entitled to do the act.

### Power of court to confiscate

26\.—(1) Where any person is convicted of an offence under this Act, the court may order the confiscation in whole or in part of —

(a) any controlled article in respect of which the offence has been committed which has been seized by, or has otherwise come into the possession of the Controller or any person acting under his authority or any vehicle, vessel or other article, the property of the accused, by means of which the offence has been committed or which is intended to be used for the commission of an offence under this Act; or

(b) the proceeds of the sale of any such controlled article if it has been sold under section 12.

### Composition of offences

29\.—(1) The Controller may compound any such offence under this Act as may be prescribed as being an offence which may be compounded by collecting from the person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence a sum of money not exceeding $2,000.

(2) The Minister may make regulations to prescribe the offences under this Act which may be compounded and the method and procedure by which such offences may be compounded under this section.

### Protection of informers

30\.—(1) Subject to this section, no evidence as to any written or oral information in respect of any offence alleged to have been committed under this Act shall be admitted in evidence in any civil or criminal proceedings whatsoever, and no witness shall be obliged or permitted to disclose the name or address of any informer or to state any matter which might lead to the discovery of the identity of the informer.

(2) If any books, documents or papers which are in evidence or liable to inspection in any civil or criminal proceedings whatsoever contained any entry in which any informer is named or described or which might lead to the discovery of his identity, the court shall cause all such passages to be concealed from view or to be obliterated so far as may be necessary to prevent the discovery of the identity of the informer, but no further.

(3) If in any civil or criminal proceedings whatsoever the court, after full enquiry into the case, is of the opinion that the informer has wilfully made in any information furnished by him a material statement which he knew or believed to be false or did not believe to be true, or the court is of the opinion that justice cannot be fully done without the discovery of the identity of the informer, it shall be lawful for the court to require the production of the original information, if in writing, and to permit enquiry and require full disclosure concerning the informer.

(4) For the purpose of this section, “informer” includes every person who is not called as a witness for the prosecution in a criminal case and who has made any complaint or report or furnished any information, oral or documentary, in respect of any offence under this Act alleged to have been committed by any person.
