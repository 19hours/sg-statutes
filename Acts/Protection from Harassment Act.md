(i) intends to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the victim; or

(c) Y repeatedly circulates revealing photographs of a classmate (X) to other classmates.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), the accused person ought reasonably to know that his course of conduct is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the victim if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think that the course of conduct is likely to have that effect.

(5) In considering whether a course of conduct is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, the court may have regard to the following factors:

(a) the number of occasions on which the acts or omissions associated with stalking were carried out;

(b) the frequency and the duration of the acts or omissions associated with stalking that were carried out;

(c) the manner in which the acts or omissions associated with stalking were carried out;

(d) the circumstances in which the acts or omissions associated with stalking were carried out;

(e) the particular combination of acts or omissions associated with stalking comprised in the course of conduct;

(g) the circumstances of the victim including his physical or mental health and personality.

(6) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and, subject to section 8, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

(7) In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (6), it is a defence for the accused person to prove —

(a) that the course of conduct was reasonable in all the circumstances;

(b) that the course of conduct was pursued under any written law or rule of law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by any person under any written law;

(c) that the course of conduct was lawfully done under a duty or power under any written law for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime; or

(d) that the course of conduct was done on behalf of the Government and was necessary for the purposes of national security, national defence or the conduct of international relations.

(8) If any dispute arises as to whether any act falls within paragraph (d) of subsection (7), a certificate issued under the hand of the Minister responsible for national security, or for national defence or for the conduct of international relations, as the case may be, stating that in his opinion any act done by a specified person on a specified occasion falls within that paragraph shall be conclusive evidence that the act falls within that paragraph.

(9) A document purporting to be a certificate issued pursuant to subsection (8) and to be issued under the hand of the Minister shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, be treated as being such a certificate.

(10) In this section —

“course of conduct” means conduct —

(a) on one occasion, if —

(i) the conduct is protracted; or

(ii) the accused person has a previous conviction under this section in respect of the same victim; or
