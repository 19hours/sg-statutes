(2) Every application under this section shall be made in the prescribed manner to the prescribed officer of the court which made the maintenance order to which the application relates.

### Power to make provisional maintenance order against person residing in reciprocating country

(b) a summons to appear before such court to answer to the complaint had been duly served on him,

the court shall have jurisdiction to hear the complaint and may, subject to subsection (2), make a maintenance order on the complaint.

(2) A maintenance order made by virtue of this section shall be a provisional order.

(3) [Deleted by Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

(4) No enactment empowering a Magistrate’s Court or District Court to refuse to make an order on a complaint on the ground that the matter in question is one which would be more conveniently dealt with by the High Court shall apply in relation to a complaint to which subsection (1) applies.

(5) Where a Magistrate’s Court or District Court makes a maintenance order which is by virtue of this section a provisional order, the following documents:

(b) a document, authenticated in the prescribed manner, setting out or summarising the evidence given in the proceedings;

(6) A maintenance order made by virtue of this section which has been confirmed by a competent court in a reciprocating country shall be treated for all purposes as if the Magistrate’s Court or District Court which made the order had made it in the form in which it was confirmed and as if the order had never been a provisional order, and subject to section 5, any such order may be enforced, varied or revoked accordingly.

### Variation and revocation of maintenance order made in Singapore

5\.—(1) This section applies to a maintenance order a certified copy of which has been sent to a reciprocating country in pursuance of section 3 and to a maintenance order made by virtue of section 4 which has been confirmed by a competent court in such a country.

(a) both the payer and the payee under the order appear in the proceedings; or

(b) the applicant appears and the appropriate process has been duly served on the other party,

the order varying the order shall be a provisional order.

(4) Where a court in Singapore makes a provisional order varying a maintenance order to which this section applies, the prescribed officer of the court shall send in the prescribed manner to the court in a reciprocating country having power to confirm the provisional order a certified copy of the provisional order together with a document, authenticated in the prescribed manner, setting out or summarising the evidence given in the proceedings.

(5) Where a certified copy of a provisional order made by a court in a reciprocating country, being an order varying or revoking a maintenance order to which this section applies, together with a document, duly authenticated, setting out or summarising the evidence given in the proceedings in which the provisional order was made, is received by the court in Singapore which made the maintenance order, that court may confirm or refuse to confirm the provisional order and, if that order is an order varying the maintenance order, confirm it either without alteration or with such alterations as it thinks reasonable.

(6) For the purpose of determining whether a provisional order should be confirmed under subsection (5), the court shall proceed as if an application for the variation or revocation, as the case may be, of the maintenance order in question had been made to it.

(7) Where a maintenance order to which this section applies has been varied by an order (including a provisional order which has been confirmed) made by a court in Singapore or by a competent court in a reciprocating country, the maintenance order shall, as from the date on which under the provisions of the order the variation is to take effect, have effect as varied by that order and, where that order was a provisional order, as if that order had been made in the form in which it was confirmed and as if it had never been a provisional order.

[Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

(8) Where a maintenance order to which this section applies has been revoked by an order made by a court in Singapore or by a competent court in a reciprocating country, including a provisional order made by the last-mentioned court which has been confirmed by a court in Singapore, the maintenance order shall, as from the date on which under the provisions of the order the revocation is to take effect, be deemed to have ceased to have effect except as respects any arrears due under the maintenance order at that date.

(a) it shall, in such manner as may be prescribed, give to the person on whose application the maintenance order was made an opportunity to consider that evidence, to make representations with respect to it and to adduce further evidence; and

(b) after considering all the evidence and any representations made by that person, it may revoke the maintenance order.

is received by the Minister from the responsible authority in a reciprocating country, and it appears to the Minister that the payer under the order is residing in Singapore, he shall send the copy of the order and documents which accompanied it to the prescribed officer of the appropriate court, and that court shall —

(i) if the payer under the order establishes any grounds on which he might have opposed the making of the order in the proceedings in which the order was made, refuse to confirm the order; and

[Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

(ii) in any other case, confirm the order either without alteration or with such alterations as it thinks reasonable.

(3) In any proceedings for the confirmation under this section of a provisional order, the statement received from the court which made the order of the grounds on which the making of the order might have been opposed by the payer under the order shall be conclusive evidence that the payer might have opposed the making of the order on any of those grounds in the proceedings in which the order was made.

[Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

(4) For the purpose of determining whether a provisional order should be confirmed under this section, the court shall proceed as if an application for a maintenance order against the payer under the provisional order had been made to it.

(5) The prescribed officer of a court having power under this section to confirm a provisional order shall, if the court confirms the order, register the order in the prescribed manner in that court, and shall, if the court refuses to confirm the order, return the certified copy of the order and the documents which accompanied it to the Minister.

### Enforcement of maintenance order registered in a Singapore court

8\.—(1) A registered order may be enforced in Singapore as if it has been made by the registering court and as if that court has had jurisdiction to make it; and proceedings for or with respect to the enforcement of any such order may be taken accordingly.

(2) A registered order which has been registered or confirmed by a District Court shall be enforceable in the manner as if the order had been made under Part VIII of the Women’s Charter [Cap. 353].

[Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

(3) Any person for the time being under an obligation to make payments in pursuance of a registered order shall give notice of any change of address to the clerk of the registering court, and any person failing without reasonable excuse to give such a notice shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500.

(4) The Magistrate’s Court or District Court by which an order is enforceable by virtue of this section, and the officers thereof, shall take all such steps for enforcing the order as may be prescribed.

(5) In any proceedings for or with respect to the enforcement of an order which is for the time being registered in any court under this Act a certificate of arrears sent to the prescribed officer of the court shall be evidence of the facts stated therein.

(6) Subject to subsection (7), sums of money payable under a registered order shall be payable in accordance with the order as from the date on which the order was made.

(7) The court having power under section 7 to confirm a provisional order may, if it decides to confirm the order, direct that the sums of money payable under the order shall be deemed to have been payable in accordance with the order as from such date, being a date later than the date on which the order was made, as it may specify; and subject to any such direction, a maintenance order registered under that section shall be treated as if it had been made in the form in which it was confirmed and as if it had never been a provisional order.

### Variation and revocation of maintenance order registered in a Singapore court

9\.—(1) Subject to this section, the registering court —

(a) shall have the like power, on an application made by the payer or payee under a registered order, to vary or revoke the order as if that court had had jurisdiction to make it; and

(b) shall have power to vary or revoke a registered order by a provisional order.

(2) The registering court shall not vary a registered order otherwise than by a provisional order unless —

(a) both the payer and the payee under the registered order are for the time being residing in Singapore;

(b) the application is made by the payee under the registered order; or

(c) the variation consists of a reduction in the rate of the payments under the registered order and is made solely on the ground that there has been a change in the financial circumstances of the payer since the registered order was made or, in the case of an order registered under section 7, since the registered order was confirmed, and the courts in the reciprocating country in which the maintenance order in question was made do not have power, according to the law in force in that country, to confirm provisional orders varying maintenance orders.

(3) The registering court shall not revoke a registered order otherwise than by a provisional order unless both the payer and the payee under the registered order are for the time being residing in Singapore.

(4) On an application for the revocation of a registered order, the registering court shall, unless both the payer and the payee under the registered order are for the time being residing in Singapore, apply the law applied by the reciprocating country in which the registered order was made; but where by virtue of this subsection the registering court is required to apply that law, that court may make a provisional order if it has reason to believe that the ground on which the application is made is a ground on which the order could be revoked according to the law applied by the reciprocating country, notwithstanding that it has not been established that it is such a ground.

(5) Where the registering court makes a provisional order varying or revoking a registered order, the prescribed officer of the court shall send in the prescribed manner to the court in the reciprocating country which made the registered order a certified copy of the provisional order together with a document, authenticated in the prescribed manner, setting out or summarising the evidence given in the proceedings.

(6) Where a certified copy of a provisional order made by a court in a reciprocating country, being an order varying a registered order, together with a document, duly authenticated, setting out or summarising the evidence given in the proceedings in which the provisional order was made, is received by the registering court, that court may confirm the order either without alteration or with such alterations as it thinks reasonable or refuse to confirm the order.

(7) For the purpose of determining whether a provisional order should be confirmed under subsection (6), the court shall proceed as if an application for the variation of the registered order had been made to it.

(8) Where a registered order has been varied by an order (including a provisional order which has been confirmed) made by a court in Singapore or by a competent court in a reciprocating country, the registered order shall, as from the date on which under the provisions of the order the variation is to take effect, have effect as varied by that order and, where that order was a provisional order, as if that order had been made in the form in which it was confirmed and as if it had never been a provisional order.

[Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

(9) Where a registered order has been revoked by an order made by a court in Singapore or by a competent court in a reciprocating country, including a provisional order made by the first-mentioned court which has been confirmed by a competent court in a reciprocating country, the registered order shall, as from the date on which under the provisions of the order the revocation is to take effect, be deemed to have ceased to have effect except as respects any arrears due under the registered order at that date.

[Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

(10) The prescribed officer of the registering court shall register in the prescribed manner any order varying a registered order other than a provisional order which is not confirmed.

### Cancellation of registration of order

10\.—(1) Where a registered order is revoked by —

(a) an order made by the registering court;

(b) a provisional order made by that court which has been confirmed by a court in a reciprocating country and notice of the confirmation is received by the registering court; or

(c) an order made by a court in such a country and notice of the revocation is received by the registering court,

the prescribed officer of the registering court shall cancel the registration; but any arrears due under the registered order at the date when its registration is cancelled by virtue of this subsection shall continue to be recoverable as if the registration had not been cancelled.

(2) Where the prescribed officer of the registering court is of the opinion that the payer under a registered order has ceased to reside within the jurisdiction of that court, he shall cancel the registration of the order and send the certified copy of the order to the Minister.

### Steps to be taken by the Minister where payer under certain orders is not residing in Singapore

11\. If at any time it appears to the Minister that the payer under a maintenance order, a certified copy of which has been received by him from a reciprocating country, is not residing in Singapore or, in the case of an order which subsequently became a registered order, has ceased to reside therein, he shall send to the responsible authority in that country —

(a) the certified copy of the order in question and a certified copy of any order varying that order;

(b) if the order has at any time been a registered order, a certificate of arrears signed by the prescribed officer;

(c) a statement giving such information as the Minister possesses as to the whereabouts of the payer; and

(d) any other relevant documents in his possession relating to the case.

[Act 2 of 2012 wef 30/09/2014]

## PART IV

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

### Appeals

12\.—(1) An applicant shall have the same right of appeal, if any, against a refusal by a court in Singapore to make a provisional order under any provision of this Act as he would have had against a refusal to make the order had a summons been duly served on the person against whom the order is sought to be made.

(2) Where in pursuance of any such provision any such court confirms or refuses to confirm a provisional order made by a court in a reciprocating country, whether a maintenance order or an order varying or revoking a maintenance order, the payer or payee under the maintenance order shall have the like right of appeal (if any) from the confirmation of, or refusal to confirm, the provisional order as he would have if that order were not a provisional order and the court which confirmed or refused to confirm it had made or, as the case may be, refused to make it.

(3) Where in pursuance of any such provision any such court makes, or refuses to make, an order varying or revoking a maintenance order made by a court in a reciprocating country, then, subject to subsection (1), the payer or payee under the maintenance order shall have the like right of appeal (if any) from that order or from the refusal to make it as he would have if the maintenance order had been made by the first-mentioned court.

(4) Nothing in this section (except subsection (1)) shall be construed as affecting any right of appeal conferred by any other written law.

### Admissibility of evidence given in reciprocating country

13\.—(1) A statement contained in —

(a) a document, duly authenticated, which purports to set out or summarise evidence given in proceedings in a court in a reciprocating country;

(b) a document, duly authenticated, which purports to set out or summarise evidence taken in such a country for the purpose of proceedings in a court in Singapore under this Act, whether in response to a request made by such a court or otherwise; or

(c) a document, duly authenticated, which purports to have been received in evidence in proceedings in a court in such a country or to be a copy of a document so received,

shall in any proceedings in a court in Singapore relating to a maintenance order to which this Act applies be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein to the same extent as oral evidence of that fact is admissible in those proceedings.

(2) A document purporting to set out or summarise evidence given as mentioned in subsection (1)(a), or taken as mentioned in subsection (1)(b), shall be deemed to be duly authenticated for the purposes of that subsection if the document purports to be certified by the judge, magistrate or other person before whom the evidence was given, or, as the case may be, by whom it was taken, to be the original document containing or recording, or, as the case may be, summarising, that evidence or a true copy of that document.

(3) A document purporting to have been received in evidence as mentioned in subsection (1)(c), or to be a copy of a document so received, shall be deemed to be duly authenticated for the purposes of that subsection if the document purports to be certified by a judge, magistrate or an officer of the court in question to have been, or to be a true copy of a document which has been, so received.

(4) It shall not be necessary in any such proceedings to prove the signature or official position of the person appearing to have given such a certificate.

(5) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the admission in evidence of any document which is admissible in evidence apart from this section.

### Obtaining of evidence needed for purpose of certain proceedings

14\.—(1) Where for the purpose of any proceedings in a court in a reciprocating country relating to a maintenance order to which this Act applies a request is made by or on behalf of that court for the taking in Singapore of the evidence of a person residing therein relating to matters specified in the request, such court in Singapore as may be prescribed shall have power to take that evidence and, after giving notice of the time and place at which the evidence is to be taken to such persons and in such manner as it thinks fit, shall take the evidence in such manner as may be prescribed.

(2) Evidence taken in compliance with such a request shall be sent in the prescribed manner by the prescribed officer of the court to the court in the reciprocating country by or on behalf of which the request was made.

(3) Where any person, not being the payer or the payee under the maintenance order to which the proceedings in question relate, is required by virtue of this section to give evidence before a court in Singapore, the court may order that there shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament such sums as appear to the court reasonably sufficient to compensate that person for the expense, trouble or loss of time properly incurred in or incidental to his attendance.

(4) A court in Singapore may for the purpose of any proceedings in that court under this Act relating to a maintenance order to which this Act applies request a court in a reciprocating country to take or provide evidence relating to such matters as may be specified in the request and may remit the case to that court for that purpose.

### Order, etc., made abroad need not be proved

15\. For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary is shown —

(a) any order made by a court in a reciprocating country purporting to bear the seal of that court or to be signed by any person in his capacity as a judge, magistrate or officer of the court, shall be deemed without further proof to have been duly sealed or, as the case may be, to have been signed by that person;

(b) the person by whom the order was signed shall be deemed without further proof to have been a judge, magistrate or officer, as the case may be, of that court when he signed it and, in the case of an officer, to have been authorised to sign it; and

### Payment of sums under orders made abroad; conversion of currency

16\.—(1) Payments of sums due under a registered order shall, while the order is registered in a court in Singapore, be made in such manner and to such person as may be prescribed.

(2) Where the sums required to be paid under a registered order are expressed in a currency other than the currency of Singapore, then, as from the relevant date, the order shall be treated as if it were an order requiring the payment of such sums in the currency of Singapore as, on the basis of the rate of exchange prevailing at that date, are equivalent to the sums so required to be paid.

(3) Where the sum specified in any statement, being a statement of the amount of any arrears due under a maintenance order made by a court in a reciprocating country, is expressed in a currency other than the currency of Singapore, that sum shall be deemed to be such sum in the currency of Singapore as, on the basis of the rate of exchange prevailing at the relevant date, is equivalent to the sum so specified.

(4) For the purposes of this section, a written certificate purporting to be signed by an officer of any bank in Singapore certifying that a specified rate of exchange prevailed between currencies at a specified date and that at such rate a specified sum in the currency of Singapore is equivalent to a specified sum in another specified currency shall be evidence of the rate of exchange so prevailing on that date and of the equivalent sums in terms of the respective currencies.

(5) In this section, “the relevant date” means —

(a) in relation to a registered order or to a statement of arrears due under a maintenance order made by a court in a reciprocating country, the date on which the order first becomes a registered order or (if earlier) the date on which it is confirmed by a court in Singapore; and
