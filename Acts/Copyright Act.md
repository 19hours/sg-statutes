69\. For the purposes of this Act —

(a) the making of an object of any kind that is in 3 dimensions does not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 2 dimensions; and

(b) the making of an object of any kind that is in 2 dimensions does not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 3 dimensions,

if the object would not appear to persons who are not experts in relation to objects of that kind to be a reproduction of the artistic work.

### Special exception for artistic works which have been industrially applied

70\.—(1) Notwithstanding section 69, the making of any useful article in 3 dimensions (including a reproduction in 2 dimensions reasonably required for the making of the article) does not infringe the copyright in an artistic work if, when the useful article or reproduction is made, the artistic work has been industrially applied in Singapore or in any other country at any time before the useful article or reproduction is made.

(b) references to the scope of the copyright in a registered design as extended to all associated designs and articles are references to the aggregate of the things which, by virtue of that written law, the registered owner would have had the exclusive right to do if —

(i) when that design was registered, there had at the same time been registered every possible design consisting of that design with modifications or variations not sufficient to alter the character or substantially to affect the identity thereof, and that owner had been registered as the owner of every such design; and

(ii) the design in question, and every other design such as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (i), had been registered in respect of all the articles to which it was capable of being applied.

(a) to do anything, during the subsistence of the copyright in the registered design, which is within the scope of the copyright in the design; or

(b) to do anything, after the copyright in the registered design has come to an end, which, if it had been done while the copyright in the design subsisted, would have been within the scope of that copyright as extended to all associated designs and articles.

[25/2000]

(1A) Subsection (1) shall have effect subject to the provisions of the Schedule in cases falling within the Schedule.

(2) Where copyright subsists in an artistic work, and —

(a) a corresponding design is applied industrially (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) by or with the licence of the owner of the copyright in the work;

(b) articles to which the design has been so applied are sold, let for hire, or offered for sale or hire whether in Singapore or elsewhere; and

(c) at the time when those articles are sold, let for hire or offered or exposed for sale or hire, they are not articles in respect of which the corresponding design has been registered or, is deemed registered under the Registered Designs Act (Cap. 266),

subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6) shall apply.

[14/94; 25/2000]

(3) Subject to subsection (5) —

(a) during the relevant period of 15 years, it shall not be an infringement of the copyright in the work to do anything which, at the time when it is done, would have been within the scope of the copyright in the design if the design had, immediately before that time, been registered in respect of all relevant articles; and

(b) after the end of the relevant period of 15 years, it shall not be an infringement of the copyright in the work to do anything which, at the time when it is done, would, if the design had been registered immediately before that time, have been within the scope of the copyright in the design as extended to all associated designs and articles.

[6/98; 25/2000]

(4) In subsection (3), “the relevant period of 15 years” means the period of 15 years beginning with the date on which articles, such as are mentioned in subsection (2)(b), were first sold, let for hire or offered for sale or hire, whether in Singapore or elsewhere.

(5) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), no account shall be taken of any articles in respect of which, at the time when they were sold, let for hire, or offered for sale or hire, the design in question was excluded from registration under the provisions of the Registered Designs Act or the Registered Designs Act 1949 of the United Kingdom (U.K. 1949, c. 88) (as the case may be), by rules made under the applicable Act (which relates to the exclusion of designs for articles which are primarily literary or artistic in character).

[25/2000]

(6) For the purposes of any proceedings under this Act a design shall be conclusively presumed to have been excluded under subsection (5) if —

(a) before the commencement of those proceedings —

(i) an application for the registration of the design in respect of those articles under the Registered Designs Act (Cap. 266); or

(ii) an application for the registration of the design in respect of those articles under the Registered Designs Act 1949 of the United Kingdom (UK 1949, c. 88), being an application made before the date of commencement of the Registered Designs Act,

has been refused;

(b) the reason or one of the reasons stated for the refusal was that the design was excluded from such registration by rules made under the Registered Designs Act or the Registered Designs Act 1949 of the United Kingdom (UK 1949, c. 88) (as the case may be); and

(c) no appeal against that refusal had been allowed before the date of the commencement of the proceedings or was pending on that date.

[25/2000]
