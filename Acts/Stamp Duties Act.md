[33/99]

(2) Where an instrument contains a statement of current rate of exchange or average price, as the case may require, and is stamped in accordance with that statement, it shall, so far as regards the subject-matter of the statement, be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be duly stamped.

(b) of equity interests in an entity; and

(c) whether or not the conveyance is —

(i) on a sale;

(ii) by way of gift, release or settlement; or

(iii) pursuant to a declaration of trust where the beneficial interest in the equity interests passes.

(2) If —

(a) the grantee is a significant owner of the entity immediately before the execution of the conveyance, or becomes one upon the execution of the conveyance; and

(b) the entity is a property-holding entity or PHE at the time of the execution,

then the conveyance is chargeable with ad valorem duty (called duty A in this section, sections 23B and 23C, Article 3A of the First Schedule and Article 2A of the Third Schedule) that is payable by the grantee.

(3) Subject to subsection (4), if —

(a) the grantor is a significant owner of the entity immediately before the effective date or becomes one on or after the effective date;

(b) the conveyance is executed at any time on or after the effective date and whether at a time when the grantor is still such significant owner or after the grantor ceases to be one;

(c) the entity is a PHE at the time of the execution; and

(d) the equity interests conveyed comprise or include equity interests in the entity specified in subsection (8),

then the conveyance is chargeable with ad valorem duty (called duty B in this section, sections 23B and 23C, Article 3A of the First Schedule and Article 2A of the Third Schedule) that is payable by the grantor.

(4) Subsection (3) does not apply to any conveyance that is executed in the period between the time the grantor (including the grantor’s associates) ceases to own any equity interests in the entity and the time the grantor becomes a significant owner of the entity again.

(5) If, at the time of the execution of the conveyance —

(a) the entity (called in this subsection the target entity) is not a PHE; and

(b) the grantee beneficially owns equity interests in another entity or entities in circumstances where, had the target entity and the other entity or entities been a single entity —

(i) that single entity would have been a Type 2 PHE; and

(ii) the grantee would have been a significant owner of that single entity or would have become such significant owner upon the execution of the conveyance,

then the conveyance is chargeable with ad valorem duty (called duty C in this section, sections 23B and 23C, Article 3A of the First Schedule and Article 2A of the Third Schedule) that is payable by the grantee.

(6) Subject to subsection (7), if —

(i) the single entity would have been a Type 2 PHE; and

(ii) the grantor would have been a significant owner of the single entity;

(b) the conveyance is executed at any time on or after the effective date and whether at a time when the grantor would still be such significant owner or after the grantor has ceased to be one; and

(c) the equity interests conveyed comprise or include equity interests in any of those entities and are equity interests specified in subsection (8),

then the conveyance is chargeable with ad valorem duty (called duty D in this section, sections 23B and 23C, Article 3A of the First Schedule and Article 2A of the Third Schedule) that is payable by the grantor.

(7) Subsection (6) does not apply to any conveyance that is executed in the period between —

(a) on or after the effective date; and

(b) within the prescribed holding period before the execution of the conveyance,

(15) For the purposes of subsection (13)(b), the amount F is determined by adding both of the following:

(a) the market value of the total tangible assets of the entity as at the end of its most recent completed accounting period;

(i) G1 is the percentage of equity interests in the 2nd entity beneficially owned by the entity; and

(ii) I is the market value of the total tangible assets of the 2nd entity as at the end of the most recent completed accounting period of the 2nd entity.

(16) For the purposes of subsections (13), (14) and (15), an entity has a significant stake in another entity if the percentage of equity interests in the other entity which it beneficially owns is not less than the percentage prescribed in the section 23 Order as the significant stake percentage.

(17) For the purposes of subsections (14)(b), (15)(b) and (16), in a case where an entity (X) (being a partnership or limited partnership) beneficially owns equity interests in another entity (Y), a partner ofXthat is itself an entity is taken to beneficially own a percentage of equity interests inYthat is calculated according to the formula L × M, where —

(a) L is the percentage of the partner’s share in the partnership; and

(b) M is the percentage which the value of equity interests inYowned byXbears to the total value of all equity interests inY.

(18) For the purposes of subsections (14)(b), (15)(b), (16) and (17), if —

(b) the 1st level entity beneficially owns equity interests in another entity (called in this subsection the 2nd level entity),

then the subject entity is taken to beneficially own a percentage of equity interests in the 2nd level entity that is calculated according to the formula N × O, where —

(i) N is the percentage which the value of equity interests in the 1st level entity beneficially owned by the subject entity bears to the total value of all equity interests in the 1st level entity; and

(ii) O is the percentage which the value of equity interests in the 2nd level entity beneficially owned by the 1st level entity bears to the total value of all equity interests in the 2nd level entity.

(19) To avoid doubt, in determining, for the purposes of subsections (14)(b), (15)(b), (16), (17) and (18), the percentage of the equity interests in an entity that are beneficially owned by another entity, all of the equity interests that the other entity owns, whether directly, or indirectly under subsection (18) through one or more chains of ownership, are to be added together.
