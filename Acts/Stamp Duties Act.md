### Instrument relating to distinct matters

(a) an instrument containing or relating to several distinct matters shall be separately and distinctly charged, as if it were a separate instrument, with duty in respect of each of the matters;

(b) an instrument made for any consideration in respect of which it is chargeable with ad valorem duty, and also for any further or other valuable consideration or considerations, shall be separately and distinctly charged, as if it were a separate instrument with duty in respect of each of the considerations.

### Mode of payment

7\.—(1) The duties for the time being chargeable upon any of the instruments specified in the Second Schedule may be paid and denoted by either impressed or adhesive stamps.

### Impressed stamps

(2) Subject to subsection (1), duties for the time being chargeable are to be paid and denoted by impressed stamps, and no instrument requiring an impressed stamp shall be deemed to be duly stamped unless it has been stamped in the manner prescribed in this section.

(3) The officer in charge of any stamp office authorised by the Commissioner to issue impressed stamps shall, on presentation to him at his office of any instrument for the purpose of being stamped with an impressed stamp, affix to the instrument an impressed stamp or stamps denoting the amount of duty paid.

[14/83]

### Adhesive stamps

(4) An instrument, the duty upon which is required or permitted by law to be denoted by an adhesive stamp, is not to be deemed duly stamped with an adhesive stamp, unless the person required by law to cancel the adhesive stamp cancels it by writing on or across the stamp his name or initials, or the name or initials of his firm, together with the true date of his so writing, or otherwise effectually cancels the stamp and renders it incapable of being used for any other instrument, or unless it is otherwise proved that the stamp appearing on the instrument was affixed thereto at the proper time.

[38/75]

### How instruments are to be written and stamped

10\.—(1) Every instrument written upon stamped paper is to be written in such manner, and every instrument partly or wholly written before being stamped shall be so stamped, that the stamp may appear on the face of the instrument and cannot be used for or applied to any other instrument written upon the same piece of paper.

(2) If more than one instrument is written upon the same piece of paper, every one of the instruments shall be separately and distinctly stamped with the duty with which it is chargeable.

### Where duty chargeable depends on duty paid on another instrument

11\. Where the duty with which an instrument is chargeable, or its exemption from duty, depends in any manner upon the duty actually paid in respect of another instrument, the payment of such last-mentioned duty shall, if application is made to the Commissioner for that purpose, and on production of both the instruments, be denoted upon such first-mentioned instrument by endorsement under the hand of the Commissioner or in such other manner, if any, as the Minister may by rules prescribe.

### Counterparts

12\. The duplicate or counterpart of an instrument chargeable with duty (except the counterpart of an instrument chargeable as a lease, such counterpart not being executed by or on behalf of any lessor or grantor) shall not be deemed duly stamped unless it is stamped as an original instrument, or unless it appears by a certificate endorsed thereon by the Commissioner that the full and proper duty has been paid upon the original instrument of which it is the duplicate or counterpart.

[4/81]

Valuation for duty

### Currency and securities

13\.—(1) Where an instrument is chargeable with ad valorem duty in respect of —

(a) any money expressed in any currency other than that of Singapore; or

(b) any stock or marketable or other security,

the duty shall be calculated on the value, on the day of the date of the instrument, of the money in the currency of Singapore according to the current rate of exchange, or of the stock or security according to the average price thereof or, if there is no price, according to the value thereof.

(2) Where an instrument contains a statement of current rate of exchange or average price, as the case may require, and is stamped in accordance with that statement, it shall, so far as regards the subject-matter of the statement, be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be duly stamped.

### Instruments reserving interest

14\. When interest or goods and services tax is expressly made payable by the terms of an instrument, the instrument shall not be chargeable with duty higher than that with which it would have been chargeable if no mention of interest or goods and services tax had been made therein.

[Act 31/93 wef 26/11/1993 vide S 466/93]

## PART III

PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PARTICULAR INSTRUMENTS

### Relief from stamp duty in case of reconstructions or amalgamations of companies

15\.—(1) If in connection with a scheme for the reconstruction of any company or companies or the amalgamation of any companies it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that there exist the following conditions:

(a) that a company with limited liability has been registered within 6 months before 1st November 1929, or that a company with limited liability is to be registered, or that since 31st October 1929 a company has been incorporated by special Act, or that since the last-mentioned date or within 6 months before 1st November 1929 the nominal share capital of a company has been increased;

(b) that the company (referred to in this section as the transferee company) is to be registered or has been incorporated or has increased its capital with a view to the acquisition either of the undertaking of, or of not less than 90% of the issued share capital of, any particular existing company;

(c) that the consideration for the acquisition (except such part thereof as consists in the transfer to or discharge by the transferee company of liabilities of the existing company) consists as to not less than 90% thereof —

(i) where an undertaking is to be acquired, in the issue of shares in the transferee company to the existing company or to holders of shares in the existing company; or

(ii) where shares are to be acquired, in the issue of shares in the transferee company to the holders of shares in the existing company in exchange for the shares held by them in the existing company,

then, subject to this section, stamp duty under article 10 (a), (aa) or (b) in the First Schedule shall not be chargeable on any instrument made for the purposes of or in connection with the transfer of the undertaking or shares.

[Act 26/96 wef 23/08/1996 vide S 386/96]

(2) No such instrument shall be deemed to be duly stamped unless either it is stamped with the duty to which it would but for this section be liable or it has been brought to the Commissioner under section 37 and he has certified under section 38 either that the full duty with which it is chargeable has been paid or that it is not chargeable with duty.

(3) In the case of an instrument made for the purposes of or in connection with a transfer to a company within the meaning of the Companies Act [Cap. 50], subsection (1) shall not apply unless the instrument is either —

(a) executed within a period of 12 months from the date of the registration of the transferee company or the date of the resolution for the increase of the nominal share capital of the transferee company, as the case may be; or

(b) made for the purpose of effecting a conveyance or transfer in pursuance of an agreement which has been filed, or particulars of which have been filed, with the Registrar of Companies within the period of 12 months.

(4) For the purposes of a claim for exemption under subsection (1), a company which has, in connection with a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation, issued any unissued share capital shall be treated as if it had increased its nominal share capital.

(5) A company shall not be deemed to be a particular existing company within the meaning of this section unless it is provided by the memorandum of association of, or the Act incorporating, the transferee company that one of the objects for which the company is established is the acquisition of the undertaking of, or shares in, the existing company, or unless it appears from the resolution, Act or other authority for the increase of the capital of the transferee company that the increase is authorised for the purpose of acquiring the undertaking of, or shares in, the existing company.

(6) Where a claim is made for exemption under this section, the Commissioner may require the delivery to him of a statutory declaration in such form as he may direct made by an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court, and of such further evidence, if any, as he considers necessary.

(7) If —

(a) where any claim for exemption from duty under this section has been allowed, it is subsequently found that any declaration or other evidence furnished in support of the claim was untrue in any material particular, or that the conditions specified in subsection (1) are not fulfilled in the reconstruction or amalgamation as actually carried out;

(b) where shares in the transferee company have been issued to the existing company in consideration of the acquisition, the existing company within a period of two years from the date, as the case may be, of the registration or incorporation, or of the authority for the increase of the capital, of the transferee company ceases, otherwise than in consequence of reconstruction, amalgamation or liquidation, to be the beneficial owner of the shares so issued to it; or

(c) where any such exemption has been allowed in connection with the acquisition by the transferee company of shares in another company, the transferee company within a period of two years from the date of its registration or incorporation or of the authority for the increase of its capital, as the case may be, ceases, otherwise than in consequence of reconstruction, amalgamation or liquidation, to be the beneficial owner of the shares so acquired,

the exemption shall be deemed not to have been allowed, and an amount equal to the duty remitted shall become payable forthwith, and shall be recoverable from the transferee company as a debt due to the Government, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum, from the date on which the duty would have become chargeable if this section had not been passed.

(8) If in the case of any scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation the Commissioner is satisfied that at the proper time for making a claim for exemption from duty under subsection (1) there were in existence all the necessary conditions for such exemption other than the condition that not less than 90% of the issued share capital of the existing company would be acquired by the transferee company, the Commissioner may, if it is proved to his satisfaction that not less than 90% of the issued capital of the existing company has under the scheme been acquired within a period of 6 months from the earlier of the two following dates:

(a) the last day of the period of one month after the first allotment of shares made for the purposes of the acquisition; or

(b) the date on which an invitation was issued to the shareholders of the existing company to accept shares in the transferee company,

and on production of the instruments on which the duty paid has been impressed, direct repayment to be made of such an amount of duty as would have been remitted if the said condition had been originally fulfilled.

(9) In this section, unless the context otherwise requires —
