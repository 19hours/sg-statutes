(a) that the person delivers to the Commissioner accounts in respect of the instruments at a date to be specified by the Commissioner in such form and containing such particulars as the Commissioner may direct;

[33/99]

### How instruments are to be written and stamped

710\.—(1) Every instrument written upon stamped paper is to be written in such manner, and every instrument partly or wholly written before being stamped shall be so stamped, that the stamp may appear on the face of the instrument and cannot be used for or applied to any other instrument written upon the same piece of paper.

(2) If more than one instrument is written upon the same piece of paper, every one of the instruments shall be separately and distinctly stamped with the duty with which it is chargeable.

7Section 10 to be repealed when section 36 of the Stamp Duties (Amendment) Act 1999 is brought into operation.

Where the duty with which an instrument is chargeable, or its exemption from duty, depends in any manner upon the duty actually paid in respect of another instrument, the payment of such last-mentioned duty may, if application is made to the Commissioner for that purpose, and on production of both the instruments, be denoted upon such first-mentioned instrument in such manner as the Minister may by rules prescribe.

[33/99]

### Counterparts

12\. The duplicate or counterpart of an instrument chargeable with duty (except the counterpart of an instrument chargeable as a lease, such counterpart not being executed by or on behalf of any lessor or grantor) shall not be deemed duly stamped unless —

Valuation for duty

### Currency and securities

13\.—(1) Where an instrument is chargeable with ad valorem duty in respect of —

(b) any stock or marketable or other security,

the duty shall be calculated on the value, on the day of the date of the instrument, of the money in the currency of Singapore according to the current rate of exchange, or of the stock or security according to the average price thereof or, if there is no price, according to the value thereof.

(2) Where an instrument contains a statement of current rate of exchange or average price, as the case may require, and is stamped in accordance with that statement, it shall, so far as regards the subject-matter of the statement, be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be duly stamped.

### Instruments reserving interest

14\. When interest or goods and services tax is expressly made payable by the terms of an instrument, the instrument shall not be chargeable with duty higher than that with which it would have been chargeable if no mention of interest or goods and services tax had been made therein.
