(a) that no corrupt or illegal practice was committed at the election by the candidate or his election agent and the offences mentioned in the report were committed contrary to the orders and without the sanction or connivance of the candidate or his election agent;

(b) that the candidate and his election agent took all reasonable means for preventing the commission of corrupt and illegal practices at the election;

(c) that the offences mentioned in the said report were of a trivial, unimportant and limited character; and

(d) that in all other respects the election was free from any corrupt or illegal practice on the part of the candidate and of his agents,

(b) that the act or omission arose from inadvertence or from accidental miscalculations or from some other reasonable cause of a like nature, and in any case did not arise from any want of good faith,

and in the circumstances it seems to the Judge, after giving the candidates, the Returning Officer, and any elector within the electoral division an opportunity of being heard, to be just that the candidate in question and the election and other agent and person, or any of them, should not be subject to any of the consequences under this Act of that act or omission, the Judge may make an order allowing that act or omission to be an exception from the provisions of this Act which would otherwise make the act or omission an illegal practice, payment, employment or hiring, and thereupon the candidate, agent or person shall not be subject to any of the consequences under this Act of that act or omission.

(a) if the candidate applies to an Election Judge or a Judge of the High Court and shows that the failure to transmit the return and statements, or any of them, or any part thereof, or any error or false statement therein, has arisen by reason of his illness, or of the absence, death, illness or misconduct of his election agent or of any clerk or officer of the agent, or by reason of inadvertence or of any reasonable cause of a like nature, and not by reason of any want of good faith on the part of the applicant; or

(b) if the election agent of the candidate applies to an Election Judge or a Judge of the High Court and shows that the failure to transmit the return and statements which he was required to transmit, or any part thereof, or any error or false statement therein, arose by reason of his illness, or of the death, illness or misconduct of any prior election agent of the candidate, or of the absence, death, illness or misconduct of any clerk, or officer of an election agent of the candidate, or by reason of inadvertence or of any reasonable cause of a like nature, and not by reason of any want of good faith on the part of the applicant,

the Judge may, after such notice of the application, and on production of such evidence of the grounds stated in the application, and of the good faith of the application, and otherwise, as to the Judge seems fit, and after giving the other candidates, the Returning Officer and any elector within the electoral division an opportunity of being heard, make such order for allowing an authorised excuse for the failure to transmit such return and statements, or for an error or false statement in such return and statements as to the Judge seems just.

(2) Where it appears to the Judge that any person being or having been an election agent has refused or failed to make such return or supply such particulars as will enable the candidate and his election agent, respectively, to comply with the provisions of this Act as to the return and statements respecting election expenses, the Judge before making an order allowing the excuse as in this section mentioned shall order the person to attend before the Judge, and shall, unless he attends and shows cause to the contrary, order him to make the return and statements, or to deliver a statement of the particulars required to be contained in the return, as to the Judge appears just, and to make or deliver them within such time and to such person and in such manner as the Judge may direct, or may order him to be examined with respect to those particulars, and, in default of compliance with that order, the person shall be guilty of an illegal practice.

(3) The order may make the allowance conditional upon the making of the return and statements in a modified form or within an extended time, and upon the compliance with such other terms as to the Judge seems best calculated for carrying into effect the objects of this Act; and an order allowing an authorised excuse shall relieve the applicant for the order from any liability or consequences under this Act in respect of the matter excused by the order; and where it is proved by the candidate to the Judge that any act or omission of the election agent in relation to the return and statements respecting election expenses was without the sanction or connivance of the candidate, and that the candidate took all reasonable means for preventing the act or omission, the Judge shall relieve the candidate from the consequences of the act or omission on the part of his election agent.

(4) The date of the order or, if conditions and terms are to be complied with, the date at which the applicant fully complies with them is referred to in this Act as the date of the allowance of the excuse.

Section 42(7)

the Parliamentary Elections Act
(Chapter 218)Directions for the Guidance of Voters in Voting

The voter may vote for one candidate or, if the electoral division is a group representation constituency, one group of candidates.

The voter has one vote.

The voter will go into the place reserved for the marking of ballot papers and mark a cross in the space provided for the purpose on the right hand side of the ballot paper opposite the name of the candidate or, if the electoral division is a group representation constituency, the names of the group of candidates, for which he votes, thus, X.

The voter will then fold up the ballot paper so as to show the official mark on the back, and without showing the front of the paper to any person, show the official mark on the back to the presiding officer, put the paper into the ballot box and forthwith leave the polling station.

If the voter inadvertently spoils a ballot paper, he can return it to the presiding officer who will, if satisfied of such inadvertence, give him another paper.

If the voter votes for more than one candidate or, if the electoral division is a group representation constituency, more than one group of candidates, on any ballot paper, his ballot paper will be void and will not be counted.

If the voter places any mark on the ballot paper by which he may afterwards be identified, his ballot paper will be void and will not be counted.
