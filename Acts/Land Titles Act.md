## PART X

EASEMENTS

### Interpretation of this Part

94\.—(1) In this Part, “dominant tenement” and “servient tenement” mean, respectively, the land to which the benefit of an easement has been made appurtenant, and the land which is subject to the burden of an easement.

(2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as altering the law relating to the natural rights to support, light, air, water, or to access to a highway, nor as altering any rule or principle of law which implies in the grant of an easement such ancillary rights as may be necessary for the effective enjoyment of the easement.

### Licences not to be registered

95\.—(1) The Registrar shall not register as an easement any instrument purporting to create an interest —

(a) of a kind which has not been recognised by law as an easement; or

(b) which is not expressed to be appurtenant to land (whether registered land or otherwise) of a person other than the proprietor or owner of the site of the easement.

(2) The Registrar shall not notify any licence in the land-register, but in any case where a licence relating to the use or enjoyment of land is by law binding on assigns of the licensor, the licensee thereunder shall be deemed to have an interest in the land for the purposes of section 115.

(3) An inadvertent contravention of this section shall not give to any interest a greater operation or effect than the interest would have had without registration or notification.

### Easements for installations

96\. For the purposes of this Act, the fact that a right to lay or maintain pipes or other installations through the land of a proprietor confers on the person or authority entitled to that right the exclusive possession or occupation of the soil, or of the space occupied by the pipes or other installations, shall not of itself prevent the right of passage of matter or energy through the pipes or other installations being registrable as an easement.

### Registration necessary for creation of easements

97\.—(1) An easement shall not be acquired over registered land by long-continued user adverse to a proprietor, nor by prescription, nor by any presumption of a lost grant, nor by any implication of law except as may be provided in this Act; but where an easement is intended to be created, the proprietor may execute an instrument of grant in the approved form, or, if the easement is being created incidentally to a transfer or lease, by appropriate words in the transfer or lease.

(2) An instrument of transfer which reserves out of the land transferred an easement appurtenant to other land of the transferor shall, upon registration, be effective as a regrant of the easement to the transferor without execution of the instrument by the transferee.

(3) The instrument creating an easement shall indicate clearly —

(a) the nature of the easement and the extent of the land burdened by the easement;

(b) the dominant tenement; and

(c) the conditions, limitations and restrictions, if any, intended to affect the enjoyment of the easement.

(4) The servient tenement shall be described in accordance with section 54 except that where an easement relates to the passage of matter or energy through underground pipes, cables or other installations, which cannot conveniently be located, the Registrar may accept for registration an instrument in which the servient land is described approximately only.

(5) An easement shall be registered by the entry of a memorial thereof on the folio for the servient tenement.

(6) A notification of the easement shall be entered on the folio for the dominant tenement unless the proprietor thereof agrees to dispense with any notification.

(7) Where a grant of an easement over registered land is expressed to be appurtenant to land which is not under the provisions of this Act, the Registrar shall not be concerned to consider whether the person described therein as grantee is entitled to the land described as the dominant tenement if that person is expressed to be the owner for the time being of that land.

### Power of court to create easements

97A\.—(1) The court may, on application by an interested person (referred to in this section as the applicant), make an order creating an easement over registered land if the easement is reasonably necessary for the effective use or development of other land (whether registered or unregistered) that will have the benefit of the easement.

(2) An order under subsection (1) may be made only if the court is satisfied —

(a) that the use of the land to which the benefit of the easement is to be made appurtenant will not be inconsistent with the public interest;

(b) that the proprietor of the land to be burdened by the easement can be adequately compensated for any loss or other disadvantage that will arise from the creation of the easement; and

(c) that all reasonable attempts have been made by the applicant to obtain the easement or an easement having the same effect directly from the proprietor of the land to be burdened by the easement.

(3) An order made under subsection (1) shall specify the nature and terms of the easement and such of the particulars referred to in section 97(3) as are appropriate.

(4) The costs of the proceedings are payable by the applicant, unless the court otherwise orders.

(5) An easement created under this section shall not bind the land to which the benefit of the easement is to be made appurtenant until it has been registered in accordance with section 97.

(6) In this section, “interested person” means a person with an interest in the land to which the benefit of an easement created under this section will be made appurtenant.

[Act 8 of 2014 wef 15/08/2014]

98\.—(1) There shall be implied in respect of each lot of land which forms part of the same development (referred to hereinafter as the lot) —

(a) in favour of the proprietor of the lot, and as appurtenant thereto, easements for the passage or provision of water, electricity, drainage, gas and sewerage through or by means of any sewers, pipes, wires, cables or ducts to the extent to which those sewers, pipes, wires, cables or ducts are capable of being used in connection with the enjoyment of the lot;

(b) as against the proprietor of the lot, and to which the lot shall be subject, easements for the passage or provision of water, electricity, drainage, gas and sewerage through or by means of any sewers, pipes, wires, cables or ducts, as appurtenant to every other lot capable of enjoying such easements.

(2) All ancillary rights and obligations reasonably necessary to make the easements referred to in subsection (1) effective shall be implied.

(4) In respect of all the easements implied by this section, there shall also be implied a covenant, binding all parties enjoying the benefit of such easements, to contribute to the cost of construction, maintenance or repair of the sewers, pipes, cables, wires or ducts — the subject of the easements — as if the easements and the covenant to contribute had been created by an instrument registered under this Act and, so long as such easements subsist, the covenant to contribute shall bind any successor in title enjoying the benefit of the easements except that such a covenant shall not be implied where the proprietor of any lot is able to show that he is entitled to enjoy the easements free from the liability to contribute.

(5) Subsection (4) shall not render any person liable to contribute to expenditure incurred at a time before he became, or after he ceased to be, a proprietor of the tenement to which the liability is attached.

(6) Unity of seisin of 2 or more lots shall not destroy the easements implied by this section but on the cessation of such unity, they shall continue in full force and effect as if the seisin had never been united.

(7) The easements implied by this section shall be enforceable without any memorial or notification on the folios, and accordingly section 97(5) and (6) shall not apply thereto.

(8) In this section —

“development” means any land subdivided into 2 or more lots under section 12(3) of the Planning Act (Cap. 232) where those lots are affected by common easements for the passage or provision of water, electricity, drainage, gas or sewerage that are capable of being created as cross easements by an instrument and enjoyed as such by those lots;

(4) Subsection (3) shall not render any person liable to contribute to expenditure incurred at a time before he became, or after he ceased to be, a proprietor of the lot to which the liability is attached.

(5) The easements implied by this section shall be enforceable without any memorial or notification on the folios, and accordingly section 97(5) and (6) shall not apply thereto.

### Extinguishment by union of tenements

100\.—(1) Except as provided in sections 98 and 99, where upon the registration of a transfer or other instrument, the same person becomes the proprietor for the same estate and in the same interest of both dominant and servient tenements, it shall be the duty of that proprietor to indicate the fact of such union of tenements in the instrument by which it is effected.

(2) Upon the registration of the transfer or other instrument, the Registrar shall, at the request of the proprietor, cancel the registration and notification of the easement except that where the survey lots have been amalgamated as one new survey lot by the Chief Surveyor pursuant to the application made by the proprietor to him, the Registrar shall, as soon as he becomes aware of that amalgamation, cancel the registration and notification of the easement.

(3) Except as provided in subsection (2), an easement, so long as it subsists, shall continue to be appurtenant to every part of the dominant tenement notwithstanding severance.

### Contribution to repairs

102\.—(1) Where an instrument creating an easement contains a covenant binding either party to contribute to the cost of construction, maintenance or repair of any way, wall, drain or any other matter (the subject of the easement), then, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the instrument, so long as the easement subsists the covenant shall bind any successor in title to that party as if the successor had been a party to the original covenant.

(a) that by reason of a change of use of the land affected, as approved by planning permission within the meaning of the Planning Act (Cap. 232), or of changes in the character of the land or the neighbourhood, or other circumstances the court considers material, the continued existence of the easement will, unless varied or extinguished, impede the development of the land for public or private purposes without securing practical benefits to the persons entitled to the easement; or

(b) that the proposed variation or extinguishment will not substantially injure the persons entitled to the easement.

(3) An order varying or extinguishing wholly or in part an easement under subsection (1) may direct the applicant to pay to any person entitled to the benefit of the easement such sum by way of compensation as the court may think just to award under one, but not both, of the following heads:

(a) a sum to make up for any loss or disadvantage suffered by that person in consequence of the variation or extinguishment;

(b) a sum to make up for any effect which the easement had at the time when it was imposed in reducing the consideration then received for the land affected by it.

(b) in the case of an instrument of mortgage or charge, if the Registrar is satisfied that the estate or interest which the caveator claims as mortgagee or chargee is one and the same interest mortgaged or charged in the instrument of mortgage or charge and the caveator may be registered as the mortgagee or chargee.

[Act 8 of 2014 wef 15/08/2014]

(4) Where, after effecting service of a notice of the intention to register a dealing in accordance with section 120(1), the Registrar registers the dealing that does not completely dispose of the estate of the registered proprietor in the land to which the caveat relates or exhaust the intended functions of the caveat, the caveat shall be deemed to have lapsed only to the extent necessary to permit the registration.

(5) Where a caveat has lapsed either wholly or partially, the Registrar shall enter in the Caveat Index or the land-register, as the case may be, an appropriate notification of the lapsing.

(6) The lapsing of a caveat under subsection (1) shall not prevent the lodgment of a fresh caveat in respect of the same matter.

(7) Where a caveat has lapsed under subsection (1)(a), any further caveat lodged in respect of the same estate or interest in land claimed under that lapsed caveat and purporting to be based on the same facts as the lapsed caveat (other than a fresh caveat lodged against any person except the caveatee named in the lapsed caveat) has no effect unless the caveator has obtained leave of the court to lodge the further caveat, and that order or a duly certified copy of that order has to accompany the further caveat when it is lodged with the Registrar.

[Act 8 of 2014 wef 15/08/2014]

(8) The Registrar shall not be concerned with the validity of the further caveat referred to in subsection (7) and if such further caveat is lodged without being accompanied by the order as mentioned in that subsection, the caveator shall be liable to pay compensation to any person who sustains pecuniary loss that is attributable to such an act or omission in complying with that subsection.

(a) the expiration of a period of 5 years commencing from the date of the lodgment of the extension of caveat which was accepted and notified on the land-register; or

(b) where more than one extension of caveat has been lodged and notified on the land-register before the expiration of each 5-year period from the date of the lodgment of the last extension of caveat which was accepted and notified on the folio, the expiration of a period of 5 years from the date of the lodgment of the last extension of caveat which was accepted and notified on the folio.

(2) Where an extension of caveat referred to in subsection (1) is accepted for notification in the land-register, the Registrar shall make an appropriate notification showing clearly the relationship between the extension of caveat and the caveat affected.

(3) The Registrar shall not accept an extension of caveat for the purpose of extending the period of validity of a prior caveat unless the nature of the claim in the extension of caveat is the same as that disclosed in the caveat.

(4) The Registrar shall not be concerned to consider or enquire into the validity of each claim except to satisfy himself that the claim expressed in each extension of caveat is similar to that expressed in the immediately prior caveat.

(5) This section shall also apply to a caveat which relates to land not brought under the provisions of this Act and was lodged and entered in the Caveat Index under sections 116 and 117.

## PART XIV

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

### Interpretation of this Part

138\. In this Part —

“dominant land” means the land to which the benefit of a restriction is annexed;

“restriction” means a restriction on the user of registered land created expressly by a covenant other than a covenant contained in a mortgage, charge or lease;

“servient land” means the land subject to the burden of a restriction.

### Notification of restrictions

139\.—(1) Any proprietor entitled to burden registered land with restrictions may do so by an instrument in the approved form and, subject to this section, the Registrar shall enter a notification of the restrictions on the folio comprising the servient land.

(2) Unless so notified a restriction shall not bind assigns of the land affected thereby.

(3) The Registrar shall not enter a notification of any such instrument unless —

(a) obligations which it purports to create are negative or restrictive; and

(b) the instrument clearly indicates the dominant and servient land.

(4) The Registrar may refuse to enter a notification of an instrument purporting to create a restriction if the obligations contained in the instrument are in part positive or affirmative.

(5) An instrument containing a restraint on the right of a proprietor to alienate or otherwise to dispose of land shall not be notified on the land-register under this section.

(6) The notification of an instrument containing a restriction which would not have been binding on assigns of the servient land shall not give the instrument any greater operation or effect than it would have had without that notification.

(7) The Registrar shall not enter on the folio a notification of any restriction contained in an instrument executed before the servient land was brought under the provisions of this Act unless the restriction appears to be enforceable wholly or in part against assigns of that land.

(8) The Registrar may, upon the application of the proprietor of the servient land, or of his own motion, cancel the notification of an instrument creating a restriction which has become unenforceable against assigns of that land, or which for any reason should not have been notified.

### Release and variation of restrictions

140\.—(1) The burden of a restriction may be released wholly or in part, and the obligation created by a restriction may be varied, by an instrument in the approved form executed by the proprietor for the time being of the dominant land and by any person having a registered interest in that land.

(2) Upon application by the proprietor of the servient land, the Registrar shall enter a notification of that instrument on the relevant folio.

(3) Where the dominant land is not under the provisions of this Act, the Registrar shall not be concerned to investigate the title to that land.

(4) The entry of a notification of an instrument of release or variation shall not give the instrument any greater operation or effect than it would have had without such entry.

(5) Without prejudice to subsection (1), upon the application of any person interested in land affected by a restriction, the court shall have power, by order, wholly or partially, to extinguish or vary the restriction, upon being satisfied —

(a) that by reason of a change of use of the land affected, as approved by planning permission within the meaning of the Planning Act, the continued existence of the restriction will impede the development of the land for public or private purposes; or

[Act 8 of 2014 wef 15/08/2014]

(b) that the proposed extinguishment or variation will not materially injure the person entitled to the benefit of the restriction.

[3/98]

(6) An order extinguishing or varying a restriction under subsection (5) may direct the applicant to pay to any person entitled to the benefit of the restriction such sum by way of compensation as the court may think just to award under one, but not both, of the following heads:

(a) a sum to make up for any loss or disadvantage suffered by that person in consequence of the extinguishment or variation; or

(b) a sum to make up for any effect which the restriction had at the time when it was imposed in reducing the consideration then received for the land affected by it.

(7) On an application to the court under subsection (5), the court shall give any necessary directions as to the persons who are or who are not to be admitted (as appearing to be entitled to the benefit of the restriction) to oppose the application.

(8) Any order made under subsection (5) is binding on all persons whether ascertained or of full age and capacity or not, then entitled, or thereafter capable of becoming entitled, to the benefit of any restriction which is extinguished, varied or dealt with, and whether those persons are parties to the proceedings or have been served with notice or not.

(9) An order may be made under subsection (5) notwithstanding that any instrument which is alleged to impose the restriction intended to be extinguished, varied or dealt with may not have been produced to the court and the court may act on such evidence as it may think sufficient.

(10) For the purposes of subsection (5), the court may dispense with personal service and may order service to be effected by an advertisement in any one or more daily newspapers or in such other manner as the court thinks fit.

(11) The Registrar shall enter on the relevant folio a notification of any order of court extinguishing wholly or in part a restriction already notified thereon, or varying the provisions of such a restriction, if the order or a duly certified copy thereof is produced to him for that purpose and upon entry of the notification, the restriction is extinguished or varied to that extent.

141\.—(1) Unless extended in the manner provided by this section, a restriction (other than a restriction referred to in subsection (2)) shall cease to be enforceable against assigns of the servient land at the expiry of 20 years from the date of entry of a notification thereof on the land-register.

[25/2001]

(2) Where a restriction was created before bringing the servient land under the provisions of this Act and the owner of the servient land is not the covenantor, the restriction shall (unless extended in the manner provided by this section) cease to be enforceable against the owner or assigns of the servient land at —

(a) the expiry of 20 years from the date of creation of the restriction;

(b) the expiry of 5 years from the date of entry of a notification thereof on the land-register; or

(4) A restriction which has not become unenforceable may from time to time be extended by an instrument in the approved form executed by any person having an interest in the dominant land and entitled to the benefit of the restriction, and the Registrar shall notify any such extension on each folio on which the restriction is notified, and on the document of title if produced for that purpose.

[Act 8 of 2014 wef 15/08/2014]

(5) Each instrument of extension may prolong the duration of a restriction for a period of 10 years from the date on which the instrument of extension has been notified in the land-register.

(6) Where for any reason (other than the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (1) and of any extension of that period) a restriction would have become unenforceable, an instrument of extension shall not prolong the duration of the restriction beyond the time for which it would otherwise have enured.

(7) Where the dominant land is not under the provisions of this Act, the Registrar, for the purpose of entering a notification of any instrument of extension executed by a person claiming to have an interest in that land, shall not be concerned to investigate the title to that land.

(8) A notification of any instrument of extension referred to in subsection (7) shall not prolong the duration of the restriction unless the person executing the instrument of extension was, at the relevant time, entitled to the interest which he claimed to have.

(9) Any restriction extended under this section shall enure for the benefit of every person who, during the period of the extension, is entitled to an interest in the dominant land.

[10/2003]

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers under subsection (1), the Registrar, of his own motion, or at the request of the aggrieved proprietor, may —

(a) correct any folio which is erroneous because of the entry of a mis-spelt name, or of the inclusion of land already included in a prior folio, or of the wrong description of parcels or of the boundaries or dimensions (including the area) of the land;

(b) correct any erroneous entry or endorsement in the land-register;

(c) add to the land-register any matter which has been erroneously omitted; or

(d) where it is not practicable to make corrections to any folio, cancel the folio and create a new folio with the corrections made thereon.

(3) Any correction to a manual folio shall be made in such manner as to leave the erroneous matter legible and show the date the correction was made and shall be authenticated by the Registrar’s signature or initials and any correction to a computer folio shall be made in such manner as to show the exact nature of the correction and the date of the correction.

(4) In any case in which the Registrar corrects the land-register, he shall have regard to any improvements to the land which may have been made since the occurrence of the error and, where 2 or more titles are involved, he may correct that folio, entry or endorsement which in his opinion involves the least loss to the assurance fund.

(5) Any person who, having dealt on the faith of an erroneous registration, has suffered loss or damage by the exercise of the power conferred on the Registrar by this section shall, subject to section 158, be entitled to be compensated from the assurance fund for the land of which he has been deprived and for any improvement made thereon by him or by any predecessor in title, and may bring an action for the recovery of such compensation.

(6) Any person having custody of a certificate of title, subsidiary certificate of title or duplicate lease required for correction may be summoned by the Registrar to deliver that certificate of title, subsidiary certificate of title or duplicate lease to him, and upon that person refusing or neglecting to do so, the Registrar may apply to the court for an order requiring that person to show cause why the certificate of title, subsidiary certificate of title or duplicate lease should not be so delivered, and the court may make such order as the circumstances of the case require.

[Act 8 of 2014 wef 15/08/2014]

(c) where the court has declared that any instrument which purports to pass any estate or interest in any residential property within the meaning of the Residential Property Act (Cap. 274) is void under section 24 of that Act.

(2) The land-register shall not be rectified so as to affect the registered estate or interest of a proprietor who is in possession unless that proprietor is a party or privy to the omission, fraud or mistake in consequence of which the rectification is sought, or has caused that omission, fraud or mistake or substantially contributed thereto by his act, neglect or default.
