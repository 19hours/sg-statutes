(2) The power of entry into possession conferred by this section shall not be exercised until one month’s notice has been given to the mortgagor or chargor.

(3) Subject to this section, a mortgagee or chargee shall have the like remedies for obtaining possession of the mortgaged or charged land as are by law given to a landlord against a lessee or tenant whose term is expired or whose rent is in arrear.

(4) Whenever a mortgagee or chargee has given notice of his intention to enter into receipt of the rents and profits of the mortgaged or charged land to the tenant or other person liable to pay or account for them, the receipt in writing of the mortgagee or chargee shall be sufficient discharge for any rents and profits therein expressed to be received, and any person paying them shall not be bound or concerned to inquire as to any default or other circumstance affecting the right of the person to give such notice beyond the fact of his being duly registered as mortgagee or chargee of the land.

### Foreclosure of mortgages

76\.—(1) In the interpretation of any law relating to foreclosure of mortgage, unless repugnant to the context, a mortgagor of registered land who is in default shall be deemed to have an equity of redemption, and a mortgagee of registered land shall have the same right to apply to the court for an order for foreclosure as if the land were not under the provisions of this Act and the mortgagee held a legal estate therein.

(2) Where the court has made an order for foreclosure upon an application made by a mortgagee of registered land, the mortgagee in whose favour the foreclosure order is made shall lodge an application in the approved form together with an office copy of the court order with the Registrar for the purpose of registering the court order under this Part; and the Registrar upon being satisfied that the court order is in order for registration shall register the order by entering a memorial of the court order in the relevant folio, and the court order when so entered in the land-register shall have the effect of vesting in the applicant mortgagee all the estate and interest of the mortgagor in the land referred to in the court order freed from all right and equity of redemption on the part of the mortgagor, and freed and discharged from all liability on account of any mortgage, charge or other interest, registered subsequently thereto except such leases or other interests as may be binding on the applicant mortgagee.

## PART X

EASEMENTS

### Interpretation

94\.—(1) In this Part,

“dominant tenement” and “servient tenement” mean, respectively, the land to which the benefit of an easement has been made appurtenant, and the land which is subject to the burden of an easement.

(2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as altering the law relating to the natural rights to support, light, air, water, or to access to a highway, nor as altering any rule or principle of law which implies in the grant of an easement such ancillary rights as may be necessary for the effective enjoyment of the easement.

### Licences not to be registered

95\.—(1) The Registrar shall not register as an easement any instrument purporting to create an interest —

(a) of a kind which has not been recognised by law as an easement; or

(b) which is not expressed to be appurtenant to land (whether registered land or otherwise) of a person other than the proprietor or owner of the site of the easement.

(2) The Registrar shall not notify any licence in the land-register, but in any case where a licence relating to the use or enjoyment of land is by law binding on assigns of the licensor, the licensee thereunder shall be deemed to have an interest in the land for the purposes of section 115.

(3) An inadvertent contravention of this section shall not give to any interest a greater operation or effect than the interest would have had without registration or notification.

### Easements for installations

96\. For the purposes of this Act, the fact that a right to lay or maintain pipes or other installations through the land of a proprietor confers on the person or authority entitled to that right the exclusive possession or occupation of the soil, or of the space occupied by the pipes or other installations, shall not of itself prevent the right of passage of matter or energy through the pipes or other installations being registrable as an easement.

### Registration necessary for creation of easements

97\.—(1) An easement shall not be acquired over registered land by long-continued user adverse to a proprietor, nor by prescription, nor by any presumption of a lost grant, nor by any implication of law except as may be provided in this Act; but where an easement is intended to be created, the proprietor may execute an instrument of grant in the approved form, or, if the easement is being created incidentally to a transfer or lease, by appropriate words in the transfer or lease.

(2) An instrument of transfer which reserves out of the land transferred an easement appurtenant to other land of the transferor shall, upon registration, be effective as a regrant of the easement to the transferor without execution of the instrument by the transferee.

(3) The instrument creating an easement shall indicate clearly —

(a) the nature of the easement and the extent of the land burdened by the easement;

(b) the dominant tenement; and

(c) the conditions, limitations and restrictions, if any, intended to affect the enjoyment of the easement.

(4) The servient tenement shall be described in accordance with section 54 except that where an easement relates to the passage of matter or energy through underground pipes, cables or other installations, which cannot conveniently be located, the Registrar may accept for registration an instrument in which the servient land is described approximately only.

(5) An easement shall be registered by the entry of a memorial thereof on the folio for the servient tenement.

(6) A notification of the easement shall be entered on the folio for the dominant tenement unless the proprietor thereof agrees to dispense with any notification.

(7) Where a grant of an easement over registered land is expressed to be appurtenant to land which is not under the provisions of this Act, the Registrar shall not be concerned to consider whether the person described therein as grantee is entitled to the land described as the dominant tenement if that person is expressed to be the owner for the time being of that land.

### Implied easements for passage of water, electricity, drainage, gas and sewerage for development

98\.—(1) There shall be implied in respect of each lot of land which forms part of the same development (referred to hereinafter as the lot) —

(a) in favour of the proprietor of the lot, and as appurtenant thereto, easements for the passage or provision of water, electricity, drainage, gas and sewerage through or by means of any sewers, pipes, wires, cables or ducts to the extent to which those sewers, pipes, wires, cables or ducts are capable of being used in connection with the enjoyment of the lot;

(b) as against the proprietor of the lot, and to which the lot shall be subject, easements for the passage or provision of water, electricity, drainage, gas and sewerage through or by means of any sewers, pipes, wires, cables or ducts, as appurtenant to every other lot capable of enjoying such easements.

(2) All ancillary rights and obligations reasonably necessary to make the easements referred to in subsection (1) effective shall be implied.

(3) The easements implied by this section entitle the proprietor of the dominant tenement to enter on the servient tenement at all reasonable times to repair, renew or restore any sewers, pipes, cables, wires or ducts as shall appear necessary but the proprietor of the dominant tenement shall make good any damage caused to the servient tenement.

(4) In respect of all the easements implied by this section, there shall also be implied a covenant, binding all parties enjoying the benefit of such easements, to contribute to the cost of construction, maintenance or repair of the sewers, pipes, cables, wires or ducts — the subject of the easements — as if the easements and the covenant to contribute had been created by an instrument registered under this Act and, so long as such easements subsist, the covenant to contribute shall bind any successor in title enjoying the benefit of the easements except that such a covenant shall not be implied where the proprietor of any lot is able to show that he is entitled to enjoy the easements free from the liability to contribute.

(5) Subsection (4) shall not render any person liable to contribute to expenditure incurred at a time before he became, or after he ceased to be, a proprietor of the tenement to which the liability attached.

(6) Unity of seisin of two or more lots shall not destroy the easements implied by this section but on the cessation of such unity they shall continue in full force and effect as if the seisin had never been united.

(7) The easements implied by this section shall be enforceable without any memorial or notification on the folios, and accordingly section 97(5) and (6) shall not apply thereto.

“lot” means a parcel of land forming part of a development, to which the Chief Surveyor has allotted a Government survey lot number;

“development” means any land subdivided into two or more lots pursuant to section 10(3) of the Planning Act [Cap. 232] where those lots are affected by common easements for the passage or provision of water, electricity, drainage, gas or sewerage that are capable of being created as cross easements by an instrument and enjoyed as such by those lots.

### Implied easements for right of way and other rights shown in an approved subdivision plan

99\.—(1) Where the competent authority has approved the development and subdivision of any land comprised in an estate before or after 1st March 1994, there shall be implied in respect of each lot of the estate which is used or intended to be used as a separate tenement (referred to hereinafter as the lot) in favour of the registered proprietor of the lot and as appurtenant thereto, all such easements of way and drainage and for party wall purposes and for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sewerage and telephone and other services to the lot on, over or under the lands appropriated or set apart for those purposes respectively on the approved subdivision plan relating to the estate as may be necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the lot and of any building or part of a building at any time thereon.

(2) All ancillary rights and obligations reasonably necessary to make the easements referred to in subsection (1) effective shall be implied.

(3) In respect of all the easements implied by this section, there shall also be implied a covenant binding all registered proprietors enjoying the benefit of such easements to contribute to the cost of maintenance or repair of the subject of the easements as if the easements and the covenant to contribute had been created by an instrument registered under this Act and so long as such easements subsist the covenant to contribute shall bind any successor in title enjoying the benefit of the easements except that in the case of the right to erect and maintain party walls, the implied covenant provided in this subsection shall bind only the registered proprietors of the lots on which party walls have been erected.

(4) Subsection (3) shall not render any person liable to contribute to expenditure incurred at a time before he became, or after he ceased to be, a proprietor of the lot to which the liability attached.

(5) The easements implied by this section shall be enforceable without any memorial or notification on the folios, and accordingly section 97(5) and (6) shall not apply thereto.

(6) Unity of seisin of two or more lots shall not destroy the easements implied by this section but on the cessation of such unity they shall continue in full force and effect as if the seisin had never been united.

(7) The easements implied by this section shall not apply to the lots in an estate where subdivision approval was given by the competent authority prior to 1st March 1994 and satisfactory documentary evidence has been produced to the Registrar of the completion of the transfer of any lot in the estate to a purchaser with easements expressly created in an instrument which has been executed and delivered to the purchaser.

(8) In this section —

(4) The Registrar shall not be concerned to consider or enquire into the validity of each claim except to satisfy himself that the claim expressed in each extension of caveat is similar to that expressed in the immediately prior caveat.

(5) This section shall also apply to a caveat which relates to land not brought under the provisions of this Act and was lodged and entered in the Caveat Index pursuant to sections 116 and 117.

(a) restraining the Registrar from registering an instrument the registration of which is prohibited by the caveat; or

(b) restraining another caveator or any party to an action or suit in which the court orders the withdrawal or removal of a caveat or in which it declines to extend the currency of a caveat from lodging another caveat in the same matter.

### Writs and orders not binding unless registered

132\.—(1) A writ of execution, or an order of court directing, appointing or empowering some person other than the proprietor to sell or otherwise to deal with or dispose of registered land, shall not bind or affect such land until particulars of the writ or order have been entered in the land-register. Such entry shall constitute a memorial of registration within the meaning of section 37.

(2) The person seeking registration shall lodge with the Registrar the writ or order, or an office copy thereof, together with an application indicating the titles in respect of which registration is required.

(3) The registration of a writ or order shall enable the Sheriff or other person named therein to execute instruments registrable in accordance with this Act.

This subsection shall not prevent the registration of a renewal of a writ, or of a second or subsequent writ issued on the same judgment except that nothing in this Act shall enable a judgment creditor by a succession of writs on the same judgment to bind land for an uninterrupted period exceeding one year.

(2) Upon the lapsing of the registration of a writ, the Registrar shall, on an application made by the proprietor or of anyone claiming through him in an approved form, cancel the registration of the writ.

### Land sold in pursuance of writs

135\.—(1) The interest in registered land which may be sold in execution under a writ shall be the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor at the date of the registration of the writ.

[S92/97]

(2) After the registration of that order pursuant to section 132, any instrument so executed shall have effect as if it had been executed by such proprietors of the land intended to be dealt with thereunder as would be necessary to pass the registered title of the estate or interest in question.

“dominant land” means the land to which the benefit of a restriction is annexed;

“servient land” means the land subject to the burden of a restriction.

### Notification of restrictions

139\.—(1) Any proprietor entitled to burden registered land with restrictions may do so by an instrument in the approved form and, subject to this section, the Registrar shall enter a notification of the restrictions on the folio comprising the servient land. Unless so notified a restriction shall not bind assigns of the land affected thereby.

(2) The Registrar shall not enter a notification of any such instrument unless —

(a) obligations which it purports to create are negative or restrictive; and

(b) the instrument clearly indicates the dominant and servient land.

(3) The Registrar may refuse to enter a notification of an instrument purporting to create a restriction if the obligations contained in the instrument are in part positive or affirmative.

(4) An instrument containing a restraint on the right of a proprietor to alienate or otherwise to dispose of land shall not be notified on the land-register pursuant to this section.

(5) The notification of an instrument containing a restriction which would not have been binding on assigns of the servient land shall not give the instrument any greater operation or effect than it would have had without that notification.

(6) The Registrar shall not enter on the folio a notification of any restriction contained in an instrument executed before the servient land was brought under the provisions of this Act unless the restriction appears to be enforceable wholly or in part against assigns of that land.

(7) The Registrar may, upon the application of the proprietor of the servient land, or of his own motion, cancel the notification of an instrument creating a restriction which has become unenforceable against assigns of that land, or which for any reason should not have been notified.

### Release and variation of restrictions

140\.—(1) The burden of a restriction may be released wholly or in part, and the obligation created by a restriction may be varied, by an instrument in the approved form executed by the proprietor for the time being of the dominant land and by any person having a registered interest in that land; and, upon application by the proprietor of the servient land, the Registrar shall enter a notification of that instrument on the relevant folio.

(2) Where the dominant land is not under the provisions of this Act, the Registrar shall not be concerned to investigate the title to that land.

(3) The entry of a notification of an instrument of release or variation shall not give the instrument any greater operation or effect than it would have had without such entry.

(4) Without prejudice to subsection (1), upon the application of any person interested in land affected by a restriction, the court shall have power, by order, wholly or partially, to extinguish or vary the restriction, upon being satisfied —

(a) that by reason of a change of user of the land affected, as approved by the competent authority or the Minister for National Development, as the case may be, under the Planning Act 1998 or any rules made thereunder, the continued existence of the restriction will impede the development of the land for public or private purposes; or

(b) that the proposed extinguishment or variation will not materially injure the person entitled to the benefit of the restriction.

(5) An order extinguishing or varying a restriction under subsection (4) may direct the applicant to pay to any person entitled to the benefit of the restriction such sum by way of compensation as the court may think just to award under one, but not both, of the following heads:

(a) a sum to make up for any loss or disadvantage suffered by that person in consequence of the extinguishment or variation; or

(b) a sum to make up for any effect which the restriction had at the time when it was imposed in reducing the consideration then received for the land affected by it.

(6) On an application to the court under subsection (4), the court shall give any necessary directions as to the persons who are or who are not to be admitted (as appearing to be entitled to the benefit of the restriction) to oppose the application.

(7) Any order made under subsection (4) is binding on all persons whether ascertained or of full age and capacity or not, then entitled, or thereafter capable of becoming entitled, to the benefit of any restriction which is extinguished, varied or dealt with, and whether those persons are parties to the proceedings or have been served with notice or not.

(8) An order may be made under subsection (4) notwithstanding that any instrument which is alleged to impose the restriction intended to be extinguished, varied or dealt with may not have been produced to the court and the court may act on such evidence as it may think sufficient.

(9) For the purposes of subsection (4), the court may dispense with personal service and may order service to be effected by an advertisement in any one or more daily newspapers or in such other manner as the court thinks fit.

(10) The Registrar shall enter on the relevant folio a notification of any order of court extinguishing wholly or in part a restriction already notified thereon, or varying the provisions of such a restriction, if the order or an office copy thereof is produced to him for that purpose and upon entry of the notification, the restriction is extinguished or varied pro tanto.

### Duration of restrictions

141\.—(1) Unless extended in the manner provided by this section, a restriction (other than a restriction referred to in subsection (1A)) shall cease to be enforceable against assigns of the servient land at the expiry of 20 years from the date of entry of a notification thereof on the land-register.

[25/2001 wef 20/08/2001]

(1A) Where a restriction was created before bringing the servient land under the provisions of this Act and the owner of the servient land is not the covenantor, the restriction shall (unless extended in the manner provided by this section) cease to be enforceable against the owner or assigns of the servient land at —

(a) the expiry of 20 years from the date of creation of the restriction;

(b) the expiry of 5 years from the date of entry of a notification thereof on the land-register; or

(c) the expiry of 24 months from the date of commencement of section 28 of the Land Titles (Amendment) Act 2001,

whichever expires the latest.

[25/2001 wef 20/08/2001]

(1B) A notification on the land-register in respect of any restriction may be cancelled by the Registrar after the restriction ceases to be enforceable under subsection (1) or (1A) or after lodgment of an application in the approved form by the proprietor of the land.

[25/2001 wef 20/08/2001]

(2) A restriction which has not become unenforceable may from time to time be extended by an instrument in the approved form executed by any person having an interest in the dominant land and entitled to the benefit of the restriction, and the Registrar shall notify any such extension on each folio on which the restriction is notified.

(3) Each instrument of extension may prolong the duration of a restriction for a period of 10 years from the date on which the instrument of extension has been notified in the land-register.

(4) Where for any reason (other than the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (1) and of any extension of that period) a restriction would have become unenforceable, an instrument of extension shall not prolong the duration of the restriction beyond the time for which it would otherwise have enured.

(5) Where the dominant land is not under the provisions of this Act, the Registrar, for the purpose of entering a notification of any instrument of extension executed by a person claiming to have an interest in that land, shall not be concerned to investigate the title to that land; but such a notification shall not prolong the duration of the restriction unless the person executing the instrument of extension was, at the relevant time, entitled to the interest which he claimed to have.

(6) Any restriction extended pursuant to this section shall enure for the benefit of every person who, during the period of the extension, is entitled to an interest in the dominant land.

under the provisions of any written law or regulations made thereunder, and which is intended to bind successive owners of the land.

(2) A statutory obligation intended to affect registered land may be notified by lodging with the Registrar an instrument of statutory obligation in the approved form, and the Registrar shall give effect thereto by entering a notification of the particulars thereof on the relevant folio or other instrument of title claimed to be affected by the statutory obligation, and on the instrument of title if produced for that purpose.

(3) The notification of an instrument of statutory obligation shall not give the statutory obligation any greater operation or effect than it would have had without such notification, nor any greater effect than is claimed for it in the instrument.

(4) Nothing in this section shall affect the personal liability of the proprietor of land affected by a statutory obligation at the time when the liability was first incurred or the statutory obligation first attached.

(5) A statutory obligation relating to a rate or tax may not be notified under this section unless the amount due exceeds the sum of $500 or 10% of the value of the land on which it is charged.

(4) On registration of an instrument of acquisition, the Registrar shall cancel the registration of all encumbrances including any mortgage, charge or lease thereby overreached and shall, if so requested, cancel the folio (and the certificate of title thereof if produced for that purpose) and shall create a new folio for the estate or interest thereby acquired.

(5) Whenever a public authority that has become the proprietor of registered land so requests, the Registrar shall endorse on the relevant folio a notification to the effect that the land has become vested in the Government as State land, and has ceased to be subject to the provisions of this Act.

144\.—(1) Where registered land is sold pursuant to —

(a) Part II of the Land Revenue Collection Act; or

(b) section 39 of the Property Tax Act [Cap. 254],

(2) Upon registration of that transfer, the land shall vest in the transferee for the estate therein set forth, freed and discharged from all trusts, obligations, estates, interests, charges and rates that have not been entered in the memorandum of prior encumbrances in the transfer, but subject to any exceptions and reservations in the State grant.

(3) Before registering any instrument executed by an attorney, the Registrar may require either —

(a) that the power of attorney or a true copy thereof be deposited in the Registry of the Supreme Court pursuant to section 48 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act; or

(b) that an office copy delivered out of the Supreme Court pursuant to section 48 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act be lodged in the Land Titles Registry for inspection or for permanent record.

(4) As between an attorney and any purchaser from him of registered land, and notwithstanding any agreement or stipulation to the contrary, there shall be implied an undertaking by the attorney to comply, at his own expense (or that of his principal), with all reasonable requirements of the Registrar made pursuant to this section.

### Exoneration of purchasers

148\.—(1) In favour of a purchaser of registered land claiming through an instrument executed by an attorney, the power under which the attorney purports to act shall be presumed to be in full force and effect at the time of such execution unless the purchaser, prior to completion of the purchase, has received notice of the revocation of the power, and the Registrar shall not be concerned to inquire as to whether or not any such notice was received.

(2) This section shall not operate to prolong the duration of a power which is expressed to terminate on a specified day, nor shall it validate any act of the attorney done after that day.

(4) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of a principal to recover damages from, or to institute other proceedings against, an agent who has exceeded his authority.

### General attorneys

(a) to powers executed within Singapore; and

(b) to powers executed outside Singapore which are expressed to be made in pursuance of this section.

(3) The generality of the authority of an attorney who has been appointed a “general attorney” shall not be restricted by reason of the fact that the instrument appointing him also confers specific powers.

### Investigation and registration fees

150\.—(1) Any purchaser of registered land from an attorney who is not a “general attorney” within the meaning of section 149 shall be entitled to be paid by the attorney —

(3) If in any such action the plaintiff recovers final judgment against the Registrar, then the court shall certify the fact of the judgment and the amount of damages and costs recovered, and the amount of those damages and (except as provided in subsection (2)) those costs shall be paid to the person recovering them, and shall be charged to the account of the assurance fund. In all other cases, the Registrar’s costs shall be payable by the plaintiff.

(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 155, any person deprived of land to a value of not more than $1,000, or sustaining loss or damage of not more than that amount, may claim against the assurance fund in the first instance and the Registrar may settle or compound the claim.

### Protection of bona fide purchasers and Registrar

(4) In any case in which the Registrar corrects the land-register, he shall have regard to any improvements to the land which may have been made since the occurrence of the error and, where two or more titles are involved, he may correct that folio, entry or endorsement which in his opinion involves the least loss to the assurance fund.

(5) Any person who, having dealt on the faith of an erroneous registration, has suffered loss or damage by the exercise of the power conferred on the Registrar by this section shall, subject to section 158, be entitled to be compensated from the assurance fund for the land of which he has been deprived and for any improvement made thereon by him or by any predecessor in title, and may bring an action for the recovery of such compensation.

(6) Any person having custody of a certificate of title or duplicate lease required for correction may be summoned by the Registrar to deliver that certificate or duplicate lease to him, and upon that person refusing or neglecting to do so, the Registrar may apply to the court for an order requiring that person to show cause why the certificate or duplicate lease should not be so delivered, and the court may make such order as the circumstances of the case require.

(7) When any person so summoned neglects or refuses to show cause, or to deliver up the certificate or duplicate lease, as directed by the court, the Registrar may, if the circumstances of the case so require, issue a replacement certificate in the same manner, and having the same effect, as provided by section 43 in the case of certificates which have been lost or destroyed or issue a subsidiary certificate of title for the lease.

(8) In this section,

“correction” includes cancellation and the addition of matter which has been omitted.

(9) For the purposes of section 158, time shall not run against any person entitled to compensation for loss or damage by reason of a correction under this section until the Registrar has given him notice that the correction has been made.

(c) where the court has declared that any instrument which purports to pass any estate or interest in any residential property within the meaning of the Residential Property Act [Cap. 274] is void pursuant to section 24 of that Act.

(2) The land-register shall not be rectified so as to affect the registered estate or interest of a proprietor who is in possession unless that proprietor is a party or privy to the omission, fraud or mistake in consequence of which the rectification is sought, or has caused that omission, fraud or mistake or substantially contributed thereto by his act, neglect or default.

(3) Subsection (2) shall not apply in the circumstances referred to in subsection (1)(c).
