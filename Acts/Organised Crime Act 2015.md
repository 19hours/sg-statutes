Division 3 —

Confiscation orders

### Application for confiscation order

61\.—(1) The Public Prosecutor may apply to the Court for a confiscation order.

(2) The Court is to make a confiscation order against a subject if it is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that —

(a) the subject has carried out organised crime activity within the statutory period; and

(b) the subject has derived benefits from the organised crime activity.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), if it is proved on a balance of probabilities that the subject holds or has at any time (whether before, on or after the date of commencement of this Part) held any property or any interest in the property (including income accruing from such property or interest) disproportionate to the subject’s known sources of income, the holding of which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the Court, then the subject is, until the contrary is proved on a balance of probabilities, presumed to have derived benefits from the organised crime activity.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), any expenditure by the subject (whether incurred before, on or after the date of commencement of this Part) is, until the contrary is proved, presumed to have been met out of the subject’s benefits from the organised crime activity.

### Amount to be recovered under confiscation order

62\.—(1) The amount to be recovered from the subject under the confiscation order is the amount the Court assesses to be the value of the benefits the subject derived from the organised crime activity carried out within the statutory period.

(2) For the purposes of this section —

(a) the benefits derived by the subject from the organised crime activity is any property or any interest in property (including income accruing from such property or interest) held by the subject at any time, whether before, on or after the date of commencement of this Part, being property or interest that is disproportionate to the subject’s known sources of income, and the holding of which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the Court; and

(b) the value of the benefits derived by the subject from the organised crime activity is the sum of the values of the properties and interests referred to in paragraph (a).

(3) In determining the value of benefits under subsection (2)(b), the Court must leave out of account the value of any benefits of organised crime activity that are shown to the Court to have been taken into account in determining the amount to be recovered under any confiscation order previously made against the subject under this Act or the CDSA.

(4) The amount in the confiscation order is recoverable from the subject by the Attorney-General in any civil court of competent jurisdiction as though it were a judgment debt due to the Government.

(b) the benefits derived by a deceased subject from the organised crime activity is any property or interest in property held by the subject during the period mentioned in paragraph (a), being property or interest disproportionate to the subject’s known sources of income, and the holding of which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the Court;

(c) the value of the benefits derived by a deceased subject from the organised crime activity is the sum of the values of those properties and interests less the value of any benefits of organised crime activity that are shown to the Court to have been taken into account in determining the amount to be recovered under any confiscation order previously made against the deceased subject under this Act or the CDSA.

(4) In this section, a reference to property or interest in property includes a reference to income accruing from such property or interest.

### Relief for third party

67\.—(1) On application by a person other than the subject within the prescribed time after a confiscation order has been made, the Court may grant such relief in relation to the exercise of any realisation power on any property held by that person as the Court considers appropriate if the Court is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, undue hardship is reasonably likely to be caused to the person if the realisation power is exercised in relation to that property.
