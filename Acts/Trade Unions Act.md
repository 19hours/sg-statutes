(2) A certified copy of any entry in the register shall be conclusive proof of the facts specified therein as on the date of such certified copy.

### Necessity for registration

8\.—(1) Every trade union established after the commencement of this Act shall apply to be registered under this Act within a period of one month reckoned from the date on which it is so established.

(2) The Registrar may, if he thinks fit, from time to time, grant an extension of the period specified in subsection (1), provided that no such period shall, in any particular case, be so extended as to exceed a period of 6 months in the aggregate.

(3) For the purposes of this Act, a trade union is established on the first date on which any workmen or employers agree to become or to create an association or combination for the furtherance of any one or more of the objects specified in the definition of a trade union in section 2.

(4) For the purpose of prosecuting any trade union which fails to apply for registration in accordance with this section, the date of establishment of that trade union shall, in the absence of proof of the date referred to in subsection (3), be deemed to be —

(a) the date on which any person is proved to have been accepted or admitted as a member of that trade union; or

(b) the date on which any act is proved to have been done by that trade union in furtherance of any one or more of the objects specified in the definition of a trade union in section 2,

and, in a case where proof is available of both the dates referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), the earlier of such dates shall be deemed so to be the date of the establishment of that trade union.

### Application for registration

9\.—(1) Every application for registration of any association or combination of workmen or employers as a trade union shall be made to the Registrar in the prescribed form and shall be signed by at least 7 members of the union, any of whom may be officers thereof.

(2) Every such application shall be accompanied by the prescribed fee and a copy of the rules of the trade union and a statement of the following particulars:

(a) the names, occupations and addresses of the members making the application;

(b) the name of the trade union and the address of its head office; and

(c) the titles, names, ages, addresses and occupations of the officers of the trade union.

[3/77]

### Registration

10\. The Registrar, if he is satisfied —

(a) that a trade union applying for registration has complied with the provisions of this Act and of the regulations made thereunder;

(b) that the objects, rules and constitution of the trade union do not conflict with any of such provisions and are not unlawful and that such rules and constitution are not oppressive or unreasonable;

(c) that the trade union is not likely to be used for unlawful purposes or for purposes inconsistent with its objects and rules; and

(d) that, where the trade union is an association or combination of workmen in a particular trade, occupation or industry, it is not likely to be used against the interests of the workmen in that particular trade, occupation or industry,

may register the trade union in the prescribed manner:

Provided that if any one of the objects of such trade union is unlawful, the registration of the trade union shall be void.

[28/82]

### Certificate of registration

11\. The Registrar, on registering a trade union under section 10, shall issue to the trade union a certificate of registration in the prescribed form and that certificate, unless proved to have been cancelled or withdrawn, shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes that the trade union has been duly registered under this Act.

### Power of Registrar to call for further particulars

12\. The Registrar may call for further information for the purpose of satisfying himself that any application complies with section 9 or that the trade union is entitled to registration under this Act.

### Power of Registrar to require alteration of name

13\. If the name under which a trade union is proposed to be registered is identical with that by which any other existing trade union has been registered or, in the opinion of the Registrar, so nearly resembles that name as to be likely to deceive or mislead the public or the members of either trade union, the Registrar shall require the persons applying for registration to alter the name of the trade union stated in the application, and shall refuse to register the trade union until the alteration has been made.

### Refusal of registration

14\. The Registrar may refuse to register any trade union —

(a) if he is not satisfied that the trade union has complied with the provisions of this Act or any regulations made thereunder;

(b) if he is of opinion that any one of the objects or rules or the constitution of the union is unlawful or conflicts with any of the provisions of this Act or any regulations made thereunder;

(c) if he is of the opinion that the constitution or any of the rules of the union is oppressive or unreasonable;

(d) if he is of the opinion that the union is likely to be used for unlawful purposes or purposes inconsistent with its objects and rules;

(e) if he is of the opinion, where the trade union is an association or combination of workmen in a particular trade, occupation or industry, that the union is likely to be used against the interests of the workmen in that particular trade, occupation or industry; or

(f) if he is satisfied, where the trade union is an association or combination of workmen in a particular trade, occupation or industry, that there is an existing union registered in respect of that particular trade, occupation or industry.

(c) if he is satisfied in the case of a trade union of workmen in a particular trade, occupation or industry, that it is being used or is likely to be used against the interests of workmen in that particular trade, occupation or industry; or

(d) if he is of the opinion in the case of a trade union of workmen in a particular trade, occupation or industry and having regard to the existence of another trade union or other trade unions of workmen in the same trade, occupation or industry that it is necessary in the interests of the workmen in that particular trade, occupation or industry, to cancel or withdraw the certificate of registration of the trade union.

[28/82]

(2) Except in a case falling within subsection (1)(a), not less than two months’ previous notice in writing specifying the ground on which it is proposed to withdraw or to cancel its certificate of registration shall be given by the Registrar to a trade union before the certificate is withdrawn or cancelled.

(3) A trade union served with a notice under subsection (2) may, at any time within a period of two months reckoned from the date of the notice, show cause in writing against the proposal to withdraw or to cancel its certificate of registration, as the case may be; and, if such cause is shown, the Registrar may hold such inquiry as he may consider necessary in the circumstances.

(4) The Registrar may, after the expiration of the period of two months referred to in subsection (3), withdraw or cancel the certificate of registration of any trade union which has failed duly to show cause under that subsection, or which, having so shown cause, has failed to satisfy him that its certificate of registration should not be withdrawn or cancelled, as the case may be.

(5) An order made by the Registrar under this section withdrawing or cancelling the certificate of registration of any trade union shall be dated as of the date on which it was made, shall specify briefly the grounds for the withdrawal or cancellation of the certificate of registration and shall forthwith be served on the trade union affected thereby.

### Power to freeze bank account

16\.—(1) Where a notice has been given by the Registrar to a trade union under section 15(2), the Minister may, if he is satisfied that it is likely that the funds of the union may be misused, by notice in writing direct any bank not to pay any money out of or honour any cheques drawn on the account of the union for a specified period not exceeding 3 months, except with the written authorisation of the Registrar.

[3/77]

(2) Where an investigation is being conducted by a public authority regarding the improper use or misapplication of the funds of a trade union, the Minister may by notice in writing direct any bank not to pay any money out of or honour any cheques drawn on the account of the union for a specified period not exceeding 3 months, except with the written authorisation of the Registrar.

(3) A bank which complies with a notice of the Minister under subsection (1) or (2) shall be relieved of any liability to any other person in respect of the payment prohibited by such a notice.

(4) Any bank which fails to comply with a notice of the Minister under subsection (1) or (2) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.

[28/82]

(2) The decision of the Minister on an appeal under section 17 shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court.

### Consequences of failure to register or of cancellation of registration
