### Short title

1\. This Act may be cited as the Hydrogen Cyanide (Fumigation) Act.

### Notice to be given of accidents resulting from fumigation

3\.—(1) Whenever any accident which occasions loss of human life or personal injury occurs as the result of the fumigation of any premises or article, the person by whom, or by whose agent, the fumigation was carried out shall forthwith send or cause to be sent to the Minister notice of the accident and of the loss of human life or personal injury.

(2) Every such person who fails to comply with this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $200.

### Coroners’ inquiries on deaths from accidents

5\.—(1) Where a Coroner holds an inquiry upon the body of any person whose death may have been caused by any accident of which notice is required by this Act to be given to the Minister, the Coroner shall adjourn the inquiry unless some person on behalf of the Minister is present to watch the proceedings except that, if the accident has not occasioned the death of more than one person, and the Coroner has sent to the Minister notice of the time and place of holding the inquiry not less than 48 hours before the time of holding it, it shall not be imperative on him to adjourn the inquiry in pursuance of this section if he thinks it is unnecessary to do so.

(2) The Coroner before adjournment may take evidence to identify the body and may order the interment thereof.

(3) The Coroner, at least 4 days before holding the adjourned inquiry, shall send to the Minister notice in writing of the time and place of holding the adjourned inquiry.

(4) A person employed on behalf of the Minister shall be at liberty at any such inquiry to examine any witness, subject nevertheless to the order of the Coroner on points of law.

(5) Where at any inquiry there is given evidence of any neglect having caused or contributed to an accident, the Coroner shall, if no person employed on behalf of the Minister is present at the inquiry, send to the Minister notice in writing of the neglect.

### Power to apply this Act to fumigations with other gases

6\. The Minister may by order apply the provisions of this Act or such of those provisions as may be specified in the order to fumigation with any substance other than hydrogen cyanide in like manner as they apply to fumigation with hydrogen cyanide subject to such adaptations, if any, as may be necessary having regard to the nature of the substance.
