[135

### Power to quash conviction as wrong in law, etc.

142\.—(1) The Military Court of Appeal shall allow an appeal against conviction by a subordinate military court if it thinks —

(a) that the finding of the subordinate military court under all the circumstances of the case is unsafe or unsatisfactory;

(b) that the finding involves a wrong decision of a question of law; or

(c) that there was a material irregularity in the course of the trial,

and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.

(3) If the Military Court of Appeal allows an appeal against conviction, it shall quash the conviction.

(4) In an appeal from an order of acquittal the Military Court of Appeal may reverse the order and direct that further enquiry shall be made or that the accused shall, subject to section 149, be retried or find him guilty and pass sentence on him according to law.

the Court shall pass on the appellant, in substitution for the sentence passed on him by the subordinate military court, such sentence so warranted as it thinks proper.

[137

### Substitution of conviction on different charge

144\.—(1) This section applies where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the subordinate military court by which he was tried could lawfully have found him guilty of some other offence, and it appears to the Military Court of Appeal that the subordinate military court must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of that other offence.

(2) The Military Court of Appeal may in the circumstances referred to in subsection (1), instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the finding of the subordinate military court a finding of guilty of the other offence, and may pass on the appellant, in substitution for the sentence passed on him by the subordinate military court, such sentence as it thinks proper, being a sentence warranted by that other offence.

[138

### Variation of conviction so as to attract different sentence

145\.—(1) Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence committed under circumstances involving the higher of two degrees of punishment, and it appears to the Military Court of Appeal that the subordinate military court by which he was tried ought to have found him guilty of the offence as being committed under circumstances involving the lower degree of punishment, the Court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the finding of the subordinate military court a finding of guilty of the offence as being committed under circumstances involving the lower degree of punishment.

(2) Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and it appears to the Military Court of Appeal that the subordinate military court by which he was tried ought to have found him guilty of the offence subject to exceptions or variations, the Court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the finding of the subordinate military court a finding of guilty of the offence subject to exceptions or variations.

(2) An appellant shall not be retried under this section for an offence other than —

(a) the offence of which he was convicted by the original subordinate military court and in respect of which his appeal is allowed as mentioned in subsection (1);

[150

### Summary rejection of appeal

157\.—(1) Where the grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law and it appears to the Military Court of Appeal that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction and that there is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead the Military Court of Appeal to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced, the appeal may, without being set down for hearing, be summarily rejected by an order under the hand of the president, certifying that the members of the Court, having perused the record, are satisfied that the appeal has been brought without any sufficient ground of complaint, and notice of such rejection shall be served upon the appellant.

180\.—(1) Any witness before an investigating officer shall be bound to state truly the facts and circumstances with which he is acquainted concerning the matter under investigation and shall answer every question put to him in the course of the investigation provided that he may decline to make a statement which may incriminate him.

(3) When a person is charged with an offence in relation to the making or contents of any statement made by him to an investigating officer in the course of an investigation, such statement may be used in or as evidence.

(4) Where a person is charged with an offence any statement, whether such statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether in the course of an investigation or not, by such person to or in the hearing of an investigating officer shall be admissible in evidence at his trial and, if such person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit.

(5) A subordinate military court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

(6) Where a person subject to military law is officially informed that he may be prosecuted for an offence in a subordinate military court, he shall be served with a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following effect:

“

You have been informed that you may be prosecuted for an offence. Do you wish to say anything in answer to the allegation that you have committed the offence? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.

”.

[17/78]

(7) Where a person subject to military law is served with a notice under subsection (6), he shall forthwith be officially informed, orally or in writing, of the date, place and nature of the offence which he is alleged to have committed.

[17/78]

(2) In subsection (1), “officially informed” means informed by an investigating officer referred to in section 177 and empowered by section 178, to investigate into the offence referred to in subsection (1).

(3) Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) shall in any proceedings in a subordinate military court —

(a) prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or other reaction of the accused in the face of anything said in his presence relating to the conduct in respect of which he is charged, in so far as evidence thereof would be admissible apart from those subsections; or

(b) be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference from any such silence or other reaction of the accused which could be drawn apart from those subsections.

(4) Subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply as regards a failure to mention a fact if the failure occurred before 28th April 1978.
