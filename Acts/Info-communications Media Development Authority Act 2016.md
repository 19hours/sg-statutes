(4) Any term or condition of employment drawn up by the Authority relating to the length of service of the transferred employee with the Authority must recognise the length of service of that employee with that transferor (including any previous service of that employee taken to be service with that transferor) to be service with the Authority.

(5) For any conduct of the transferred employee when he or she was employed by that transferor which would have rendered that employee liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished by that transferor, the Authority may —

(a) start any disciplinary proceedings against that employee;

(b) carry on and complete any disciplinary proceedings started by that transferor against that employee if those proceedings are pending on the eve of the transfer date; and

(c) reprimand, reduce in rank, retire, dismiss or otherwise punish that employee as if that employee were not transferred and this Act had not been enacted.

(a) was in the course of being heard or investigated by a committee of that transferor acting under due authority; or

(b) had been heard or investigated, but no order, ruling or direction had been made, by that committee,
