Note:

[29th December 1899]

Whereas the Presbyterian Church of England, constituted at Liverpool on the thirteenth day of June, 1876, has a congregation in Singapore, who worship at a church erected upon a piece of land granted to certain persons as trustees by the Governor:

And Whereas Thomas Dunman, formerly of Singapore, Commissioner of Police, being entitled to the two pieces of land described in ScheduleAfor the respective residues of the terms of nine hundred and ninety-nine years mentioned in the said Schedule, subject to the payment of the rents reserved by and to the observance and performance of the covenants and conditions contained in the indentures mentioned in the said Schedule, subdivided the same into thirty-one building allotments, which he demised by thirty-one indentures of lease unto certain lessees for terms of ninety-nine years, reserving to himself the yearly rent of two dollars on each of such leases:

And Whereas by an indenture dated the fourteenth day of February, 1879, and made between the said Thomas Dunman of the first part and Robert Little, John Hutchinson Robertson, Samuel Dunlop, John Anderson, Robert Jamie, Alexander Maughan Martin, Thomas Cuthbertson, William McKerrow and William Alexander Pickering of the second part, the said Thomas Dunman conveyed the said two pieces of land together with the said rents unto the parties of the second part, thereinafter referred to as the said trustees upon trust, that they should stand possessed of the said pieces of land and the yearly rents and profits arising out of the same, to receive the said rents and profits, and to expend and apply the same for the purpose of maintaining and upholding the said church or any church which should thereafter be erected in substitution therefor, and for the purpose of defraying all expenses in connection with the said church and with the religious worship in Singapore of the denomination of Christians holding as their confession of faith the ecclesiastical documents received by the different branches of the Presbyterian Church and known as the Westminster Standards, in such manner from time to time as the said trustees or a majority of them should from time to time, in their discretion, think proper:

And Whereas the indenture in recital contained certain powers enabling the said trustees to sell the said pieces of land and to perform certain other acts, and a provision whereby vacancies in their number could be filled up, followed by a proviso that it should not be imperative to fill up such vacancies until the number of trustees should be reduced to two:

And Whereas the piece of land upon which the said church is erected is described in ScheduleBand is held under a Statutory Land Grant dated the sixteenth day of August, 1892, whereby the Governor of the Colony granted to John Anderson, Charles Phillips, Alexander Johnston, Robert Park, Theodore Page, Robert Allan, Arthur Knight, David James Galloway, John Graham, Robert Little, William Paterson Waddell, Joseph Mactaggart Allinson and Francis Warrack, as trustees for the Presbyterian Church in Singapore, thereafter named the trustees, the said piece of land to hold to the said trustees, their heirs and assigns, in trust for the purposes of the Presbyterian Church, on the said piece of land, erected or any buildings thereafter to be thereon erected, for religious worship and use of any denomination of Christians holding as their confession of faith the ecclesiastical documents received by the different branches of the Presbyterian Church and known as the Westminster Standards for ever:

And Whereas the Statutory Land Grant contained a provision for appointing new trustees, with liberty upon any appointment to increase or diminish the original number of trustees but so that it be not reduced below two, and also a proviso that if at any time thereafter public worship should cease in the church aforesaid or in any building thereafter to be erected on the said land for the space of two years, or if such building or buildings should not be maintained thereon or kept in such a state of repair as to fit them for the purposes for which they were built, the said land should forthwith revert to Her Majesty together with all the erections and buildings thereon:

And Whereas the finances of the said congregation are managed by a Treasurer, who is appointed by the Board of Managers of the said Congregation, the present Treasurer being Francis Warrack:

And Whereas it is expedient for conveyancing purposes to incorporate the Treasurer for the time being of the said congregation and to appoint him trustee of the said indenture of the fourteenth day of February, 1879, and of the said Statutory Land Grant of the sixteenth day of August, 1892:

It is hereby enacted by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council thereof, as follows:
