REGISTRATION OF TRADE MARKS

Introductory

### Registered trade marks

4\.—(1) A registered trade mark is a property right obtained by the registration of the trade mark under this Act and the proprietor of a registered trade mark has the rights and remedies provided by this Act.

(2) No proceedings shall lie to prevent or recover damages for the infringement of an unregistered trade mark as such; but nothing in this Act shall affect the law relating to passing off or rights under the Geographical Indications Act (Cap. 117B).

Application for registration of trade mark

### Application for registration

5\.—(1) An application for registration of a trade mark shall be made in the prescribed manner to the Registrar.

(2) The application shall state that the trade mark is being used in the course of trade, by the applicant or with his consent, in relation to those goods or services, or that he has a bona fide intention that it should be so used.

(3) The application shall be subject to the payment of the application fee and such other fees as may be appropriate.

### Classification of goods and services

6\.—(1) Goods and services shall be classified for the purposes of the registration of trade marks according to a prescribed system of classification.

(2) Any question arising as to the class within which any goods or services fall shall be determined by the Registrar, whose decision shall be final.

Grounds for refusal of registration

### Absolute grounds for refusal of registration

7\.—(1) The following shall not be registered:

(a) signs which do not satisfy the definition of a trade mark in section 2(1);

(b) trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character;

(c) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of services, or other characteristics of goods or services; and

(d) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade.

(2) A trade mark shall not be refused registration by virtue of subsection (1)(b), (c) or (d) if, before the date of application for registration, it has in fact acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it.

(3) A sign shall not be registered as a trade mark if it consists exclusively of —

(a) the shape which results from the nature of the goods themselves;

(b) the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result; or

(c) the shape which gives substantial value to the goods.

(4) A trade mark shall not be registered if it is —

(a) contrary to public policy or to morality; or

(b) of such a nature as to deceive the public (for instance as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of the goods or service).

(5) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that its use is prohibited in Singapore by any written law or rule of law.

(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the application is made in bad faith.

(7) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a trade mark shall not be registered if it contains or consists of a geographical indication in respect of a wine or spirit and the trade mark is used or intended to be used in relation to a wine or spirit not originating from the place indicated in the geographical indication.

(8) Subsection (7) shall apply whether or not the trade mark has, or is accompanied by, an indication of the true geographical origin of the wine or spirit, as the case may be, or an expression such as “kind”, “type”, “style”, “imitation” or the like, and irrespective of the language the geographical indication is expressed in that trade mark.

(9) A trade mark shall not be refused registration by virtue of subsection (7) if the application for its registration had been made in good faith, or if it had been used continuously in good faith in the course of trade by the applicant for its registration or his predecessor in title, either —

(a) before 15th January 1999; or

(b) before the geographical indication in question is protected in its country of origin.

(10) A trade mark shall not be refused registration by virtue of subsection (7) if the geographical indication in question —

(a) has ceased to be protected; or

(b) has fallen into disuse,

in its country of origin.

(11) A trade mark shall not be registered in the cases specified in sections 56 and 57.

(12) The Minister may make rules to provide that a sign specified in the rules shall not be registered as a trade mark, or shall not be so registered unless such conditions as may be prescribed are met.

(13) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the registration contravenes any rule made under subsection (12).

### Relative grounds for refusal of registration

8\.—(1) A trade mark shall not be registered if it is identical with an earlier trade mark and the goods or services for which the trade mark is sought to be registered are identical with the goods or services for which the earlier trade mark is protected.

(2) A trade mark shall not be registered if because —

(a) it is identical with an earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods or services similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is protected; or

(b) it is similar to an earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods or services identical with or similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is protected,

there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.

(3) A trade mark which —

(a) is identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and

(b) is to be registered for goods or services which are not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is protected,

shall not be registered if —

(i) the earlier trade mark is well known in Singapore;

(ii) use of the later trade mark in relation to the goods or services for which the later trade mark is sought to be registered would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the proprietor of the earlier trade mark;

(iii) there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public because of such use; and

(iv) the interests of the proprietor of the earlier trade mark are likely to be damaged by such use.

(4) A trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in Singapore is liable to be prevented —

(a) by virtue of any rule of law (in particular, the law of passing off) protecting an unregistered trade mark or other sign used in the course of trade; or

(b) by virtue of an earlier right other than those referred to in subsections (1), (2) and (3) or paragraph (a), in particular by virtue of the law of copyright or any law with regard to the protection of designs.

(5) A person entitled under subsection (4) to prevent the use of a trade mark is referred to in this Act as the proprietor of an earlier right in relation to the trade mark.

(6) The Registrar may, in his discretion, register a trade mark where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark or other earlier right consents to the registration.

(7) A trade mark which is an earlier trade mark by virtue of paragraph (a) of the definition of "earlier trade mark" in section 2(1) and whose registration expires shall continue to be taken into account in determining the registrability of a later mark for a period of one year after the expiry unless the Registrar is satisfied that there was no bona fide use of the mark during the 2 years immediately preceding the expiry.

### Raising of relative grounds in case of honest concurrent use

9\.—(1) Where, on an application for the registration of a trade mark, it appears to the Registrar —

(a) that there is an earlier trade mark in relation to which the conditions set out in section 8(1), (2) or (3) apply; or

(b) that there is an earlier right in relation to which the condition set out in section 8(4) is satisfied,

but the applicant shows to the satisfaction of the Registrar that there has been honest concurrent use in the course of trade in Singapore of the trade mark for which registration is sought, the Registrar shall not refuse the application by reason of the earlier trade mark or other earlier right unless objection on that ground is raised in opposition proceedings by the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier right.

(2) Nothing in this section shall affect —

(a) the refusal of registration on the grounds mentioned in section 7; or

(b) the making of an application for a declaration of invalidity under section 23(3).

Priority

### Claim to priority of Convention application

10\.—(1) If —

(a) a person has filed an application for the registration of a trade mark in a Convention country (referred to in this section as a Convention application); and

(b) within 6 months after the date on which the Convention application is made, he or his successor in title applies under this Act for the registration of the trade mark in respect of some or all of the goods or services in respect of which registration was sought in that Convention country,

he or his successor in title may, when filing the application under this Act, claim a right of priority for the registration of the trade mark in respect of all or any of those goods or services.

(2) The priority claimed is for the registration of the trade mark in respect of the goods or services from (and including) the date on which the application was filed in that Convention country.

(3) The registrability of a trade mark shall not be affected by any use of the trade mark in Singapore in the period between the date of filing of the Convention application and the date of application under this Act.

(4) Any filing which in a Convention country is equivalent to a regular national filing, under its domestic legislation or an international agreement, shall be treated as giving rise to the right of priority.

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), “regular national filing” means a filing which is adequate to establish the date on which the application was filed in the Convention country, whatever may be the subsequent fate of the application.

(6) Where a subsequent application concerning the same subject as an earlier Convention application was filed in the same Convention country, and —

(a) the earlier application has been withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without having been laid open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding; and

(b) the earlier application has not yet served as a basis for claiming a right of priority,

the date the subsequent application was filed, rather than that of the earlier application, shall be considered the starting date of the period of priority under subsection (2), and the earlier application may not thereafter serve as a basis for claiming priority.

(7) The Minister may make rules as to the manner of claiming priority under this section.

(8) A right to priority arising under this section may be assigned or otherwise transmitted, either with the application or independently, and the reference in subsection (1) to the applicant’s “successor in title” shall be construed accordingly.

### Claim to priority from other relevant overseas application

11\.—(1) The Minister may by order confer on a person who has filed an application for the registration of a trade mark in a country or territory to which the Government has entered into a treaty, convention, arrangement or engagement for the reciprocal protection of trade marks, a right to priority, for the purpose of registering the same trade mark under this Act for some or all of the same goods or services, for a specified period from the date of filing of that application.

(2) An order under this section may make provision corresponding to that set out in section 10 or such other provision as appears to the Minister to be appropriate.

Registration procedure

### Examination of application

12\.—(1) The Registrar shall examine whether an application for registration of a trade mark satisfies the requirements of this Act (including any requirements imposed by rules made under this Act).

(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), the Registrar may carry out a search, to such extent as he considers necessary, of earlier trade marks.

(3) If it appears to the Registrar that the requirements for registration are not met, the Registrar shall inform the applicant and give him an opportunity, within such period as may be prescribed, to make representations or to amend the application.

(4) If the applicant fails to satisfy the Registrar that those requirements are met, or to amend the application so as to meet them, or fails to respond before the end of the prescribed period, the Registrar shall refuse to accept the application.

(5) If it appears to the Registrar that the requirements for registration are met, the Registrar shall accept the application.

### Publication and opposition proceedings

13\.—(1) When an application for registration has been accepted, the Registrar shall cause the application to be published in the prescribed manner.

(2) Any person may, within the prescribed time from the date of the publication of the application, give notice to the Registrar of opposition to the registration.

(3) The notice shall be given in writing in the prescribed manner, and shall include a statement of the grounds of opposition and such other matter as may be prescribed.

(4) The Minister may make rules to provide for opposition proceedings and for matters relating thereto.

### Withdrawal, restriction or amendment of application

14\.—(1) The applicant may at any time withdraw his application or restrict the goods or services covered by the application.

(2) If the application has been published, the withdrawal or restriction shall also be published.

(3) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground —

(a) that there is an earlier trade mark in relation to which the conditions set out in section 8(1), (2) or (3) apply; or

whichever is the earlier, unless the applicant shows to the satisfaction of the Registrar that the registration of the trade mark was applied for in bad faith.

(7) Where the ground of invalidity exists in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the trade mark is registered, the trade mark shall be declared invalid as regards those goods or services only.

(8) Where the registration of a trade mark is declared invalid to any extent, the registration shall to that extent be deemed never to have been made, but this shall not affect transactions past and closed.

### Effect of acquiescence

24\.—(1) Where the proprietor of an earlier trade mark or other earlier right has acquiesced for a continuous period of 5 years in the use in the course of trade of a registered trade mark in Singapore, being aware of that use, there shall cease to be any entitlement on the basis of that earlier trade mark or other right —

(a) to apply for a declaration that the registration of the later trade mark is invalid; or
