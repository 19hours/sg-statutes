(4) Where any code of practice is issued, amended, added to or revoked by the Authority under subsection (1), the Authority must —

(a) publish a notice of the issue, amendment, addition or revocation, as the case may be, of the code of practice as will secure adequate publicity for such issue, amendment, addition or revocation;

(8) Any contravention or failure to comply by a registered provider with any code of practice applicable to the registered provider does not of itself render the registered provider liable to criminal proceedings, but any such contravention or non‑compliance may, in any proceedings (criminal or otherwise under this Act), be relied on by any party to those proceedings as tending to establish or negate any liability which is in question in those proceedings.

### Directions

18\.—(1) The Authority may (without compensation) give any direction to a registered provider if the Authority has reasonable grounds to believe that —

(a) the registered provider is providing a third‑party taxi booking service in a manner that may adversely affect the availability of taxi services for hail on roads in Singapore;

(4) In determining whether it is appropriate or requisite that a compliance order (instead of a regulatory sanction under section 20) be imposed, the Authority must have regard to, and give such weight as the Authority considers appropriate to, all of the following matters:

(a) the extent that any person is likely to sustain loss or damage due to anything likely to be done, or omitted to be done, as a result of the contravention or the non‑compliance, if no regulatory sanction under section 20 is imposed;

(b) whether a compliance order is proportionate to the nature of the contravention or non‑compliance;

(c) whether the contravention or non‑compliance is rectifiable.

(5) The Authority must, before imposing any compliance order, give notice to the registered provider concerned —

(a) stating that the Authority intends to impose a compliance order against the registered provider;

(b) specifying the instance of contravention or non‑compliance that is the subject of the proposed compliance order; and

(c) specifying the time (not being less than 28 days after the date of service of the notice) within which written representations may be made to the Authority with respect to the proposed compliance order.

(6) The Authority may, after considering any written representation under subsection (5)(c), impose such compliance order on the registered provider as the Authority considers appropriate by giving written notice to the registered provider of that compliance order.

(7) A registered provider must comply with every compliance order imposed on the registered provider by the Authority under this section.

### Surrender of certificate of registration

### Powers of enforcement

24\.—(1) For the purposes of finding out whether any condition of registration, any direction under section 18 or any provision of a code of practice has been or is being contravened or not complied with, or whether there is any act or omission that results in a failure to provide a third‑party taxi booking service that is safe, reliable and efficient, an officer of the Authority may do all or any of the following in relation to any person after declaring his or her office and producing such identification card as the Chief Executive of the Authority may direct to be carried by officers of the Authority:

(a) require any person whom the officer reasonably believes to have committed the contravention or non‑compliance, or done the act or made the omission, to furnish evidence of the person’s identity;

(b) require any person to furnish any information, or produce any record or document (or copy of any record or document) in the possession of that person, and may, without giving any fee or reward, inspect, copy or take extracts from such record or document;

shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
