And Whereas it is desirable that statutory provision be made in relation to the transfer of the property, assets, liabilities and employees of the Nanyang Technological University to the company, the operation of the company and certain of the powers of the company.

Be it enacted by the President with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Singapore, as follows:
