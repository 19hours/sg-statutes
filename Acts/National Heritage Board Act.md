(2) Any order, ruling or direction made or given by the Government or committee pursuant to this section shall be treated as an order, ruling or direction of the Board and have the same force or effect as if it had been made or given by the Board pursuant to the authority vested in the Board under this Act.

44\. The Board may reprimand, reduce in rank, retire, dismiss or punish in some other manner a person transferred to the service of the Board under section 40 for any misconduct or neglect of duty committed prior to 1st August 1993 which would have rendered him liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished in some other manner by the Government as if this Act had not been enacted.

### Interpretation of this Part
