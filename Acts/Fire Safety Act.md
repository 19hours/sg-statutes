a notice in writing (referred to in this Act as a fire hazard abatement notice) requiring him to abate the fire hazard within the period specified in the notice, and to do all such things as may be necessary for that purpose, and the notice may, if the Commissioner thinks fit, specify any works to be executed for the purposes aforesaid.

(2) Where the person by reason of whose act, default or sufferance a fire hazard arose or continues cannot be found and it is clear that the fire hazard neither arose nor continues by reason of any act, default or sufferance on the part of the occupier or owner of the premises in or on which it exists, the Commissioner may abate the hazard and may do what is necessary to prevent a recurrence thereof.

(3) Where a fire hazard abatement notice is served on any person pursuant to subsection (1) and that person fails to comply with any of the requirements of the notice within the time specified therein, he shall, whether or not an order under section 16 has been made in respect of him, be guilty of an offence.

### Commissioner may abate fire hazard in emergency

14\. Where a fire hazard abatement notice has been served upon any person pursuant to section 13 and if the person on whom the notice has been served fails to comply with any of the requirements of the notice within the time specified therein, the Commissioner may if he is satisfied that the fire hazard to which the notice relates —

(a) constitutes an immediate or substantial danger of fire in or on the premises; or

(b) is likely, if fire breaks out in or on the premises, to increase the normal risk to life which occurs in the event of a fire,

cause to be carried out in or on the premises such work including the removal and seizure of any property causing the fire hazard as appears to him to be necessary to abate the fire hazard and to prevent a recurrence thereof and may recover the expenses incurred thereby from the person on whom the notice has been served.

### Power to order closure of premises in emergency

15\.—(1) The Commissioner may, if he is satisfied of the matters specified in section 14 and that the safety of persons in the premises cannot reasonably be ensured by other means —

(a) order the owner or occupier of the premises forthwith to close the premises for such period not exceeding 72 hours as is specified in that order and as the Commissioner considers necessary for the alleviation of the danger in question; or

(b) if an order referred to in paragraph (a) cannot for any reason be given to the owner or occupier of the premises or if such an order, having been given to that owner or occupier, is not forthwith obeyed, close the premises for such period not exceeding 72 hours as the Commissioner considers necessary for the alleviation of the danger in question, using such force as is reasonably necessary for the removal from the premises of persons therein without doing them bodily harm.

(2) The Commissioner giving an order under subsection (1) shall do so —

(a) in writing served on the owner or occupier of the premises in question; or

(b) orally, in which case he shall, as soon as is practicable thereafter, serve on the owner or occupier of the premises in question confirmation in writing of the contents of that order and of the time and place at which that order was so given, and shall cause a copy of that order or confirmation, as the case requires, to be affixed to that premises in a conspicuous position.

(3) The Commissioner may, if he considers that the danger to which an order given under subsection (1) relates has been alleviated, rescind that order.

(4) Any police officer may, if requested by the Commissioner or an authorised officer to do so, assist the Commissioner or authorised officer in the exercise of any power conferred on the Commissioner by this section.

(5) If the Commissioner or an authorised officer considers that a danger in relation to which he has exercised the power conferred on him by subsection (1) cannot be, or has not been, alleviated within a period of 72 hours referred to in that subsection, he shall, having given such prior notice of his intention to do so to the owner or occupier of the premises in question as is practicable in the circumstances, apply to a Magistrate’s Court for an order directing the owner or occupier to close or keep closed, as the case requires, that premises for such period as the Court considers necessary for the alleviation of that danger.

(6) A Magistrate’s Court may, on an application made to the Court under subsection (5), grant, subject to such conditions as the Court thinks fit to impose, the order sought by the application.

(7) If an application is made to a Magistrate’s Court under subsection (5) while the premises in question is closed under subsection (1), that closure shall continue until the application is finally determined or is withdrawn.

(8) Any person who without reasonable excuse fails to comply with any closing order granted by the Commissioner under subsection (1) or the order made by the Magistrate’s Court under subsection (6) shall be guilty of an offence.

(a) that person fails to comply with any of the requirements of the notice within the time specified therein; or

(b) the fire hazard, although abated since the service of the notice, is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, likely to recur in or on the same premises,

(2) A fire hazard order referred to in subsection (1) may be —

(a) an abatement order, that is to say, an order which requires a person to comply with all or any of the requirements of a fire hazard abatement notice in connection with which the order is made, or otherwise to abate the fire hazard or to do what may be necessary to prevent the recurrence of the fire hazard within the period specified in the order;

(4) A Magistrate’s Court, if satisfied that any premises in respect of which a prohibition order or a closing order granted under section 15(6) or this section is in force has been rendered suitable for the use specified in the order, may, on application by the Commissioner or the owner or occupier of the premises, declare that it is so satisfied and revoke the prohibition order or closing order.

(5) Any person who without reasonable excuse contravenes a fire hazard order shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $500 for every day during which the default continues after conviction.

(6) Without prejudice to subsection (5), where a fire hazard order has not been complied with, the Commissioner may abate the fire hazard and may do whatever may be necessary in the execution of the order, and may recover any expenses reasonably incurred thereby from the person against whom the order was made.

### Provision as to appeal against order

(2) There shall be no appeal to the High Court against a fire hazard order, unless it is or includes a closing order or requires the execution of structural works.

(3) Where a fire hazard order is made and a person does not comply with it and appeals against it to the High Court and the appeal is dismissed or is abandoned, the appellant shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500 for every day during the non-compliance with the order, unless he satisfies the court before which proceedings are taken for imposing a fine that there was substantial ground for the appeal and that the appeal was not brought merely for the purpose of delay and, where the appeal is heard by the High Court, the High Court may, on dismissing the appeal, impose the fine as if the High Court were the court before which proceedings were taken for imposition of the fine.

(4) In the event of an appeal against a fire hazard order, no work, except as mentioned in subsection (5), shall be done pursuant to section 16(6) under the order until after the determination or abandonment of the appeal.

(5) If the court by which the order was made is of the opinion that the nature of the fire hazard is such as to require immediate abatement, the court may, notwithstanding that the appeal is pending, authorise the Commissioner immediately to abate the hazard:

Provided that —

(a) if the appeal is allowed, the Commissioner shall pay to the person against whom the order was made the amount of any damage sustained by him by reason of the abatement of the hazard by the Commissioner; and
