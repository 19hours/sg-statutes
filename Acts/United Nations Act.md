(a) the apprehension, trial and punishment of persons offending against the regulations; and

(b) empowering any person or class of persons to exercise, when investigating any offence under this Act or any regulations made thereunder, all or any of the powers of a police officer under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) in relation to seizable offences.

(2) The measures to be applied under subsection (1) shall not apply to any financial institution or class of financial institutions to the extent that the financial institution or class of financial institutions is or may be subject to the directions of the Monetary Authority of Singapore under section 27A of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act (Cap. 186).

(3) No regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be invalid because it deals with any matter provided for by any written law, or because of repugnancy to or inconsistency with any written law other than the Constitution.

(a) any party to a contract for failing, neglecting or refusing to carry out any act required by the contract; or

(b) any person for failing, neglecting or refusing to carry out any act under any written law,

(2) Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of the Frustrated Contracts Act (Cap. 115).

### Protection of persons for acts done under this Act

### Liability for breach of regulations

5\.—(1) Every person who commits, or attempts to commit, or does any act with intent to commit, or counsels, procures, aids, abets, or incites any other person to commit, or conspires with any other person (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) to commit any offence against any regulations made under this Act shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

(2) Nothing in this Act or any regulations made thereunder shall prevent any person from being prosecuted under any other written law for any act or omission which constitutes an offence under this Act or any regulations made thereunder, or from being liable under that other written law to any punishment or penalty higher or other than that provided by this Act or the regulations, but no person shall be punished twice for the same offence.
