(3) The trustees shall not be bound to obtain any report as to the value of the land or other property to be comprised in such mortgage, or any advice as to the making of the loan, and shall not be liable for any loss which may be incurred by reson only of the security being insufficient at the date of the mortgage.

18\.—(1) The receipt in writing of a trustee for any money, securities, or other personal property or effects payable, transferable or deliverable to him under any trust or power shall be a sufficient discharge to the person paying, transferring or delivering the same and shall effectually exonerate him from seeing to the application or being answerable for any loss or misapplication thereof.

(2) This section does not, except where the trustee is a trust corporation, enable a sole trustee to give a valid receipt for the proceeds of sale or other capital money arising under a trust for sale of land.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a disposition on trust for sale of land or in the settlement of the net proceeds, the proceeds of sale or other capital money arising under the disposition shall not be paid to or applied by the direction of fewer than two persons as trustees of the disposition, except where the trustee is a trust corporation, but this subsection does not affect the right of a sole personal representative as such to give valid receipts for or direct the application of the proceeds of sale or other capital money aforesaid; nor, except where capital money arises on a transaction, render it necessary to have more than one trustee.

(4) This section shall apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the instrument, if any, creating the trust.

### Power to compound liabilities

19\. A personal representative, or two or more trustees acting together, or, subject to the restrictions imposed in regard to receipts by a sole trustee not being a trust corporation, a sole acting trustee where by the instrument, if any, creating the trust, or by statute, a sole trustee is authorised to execute the trusts and powers reposed in him, may, if and as he or they think fit —

(c) pay or allow any debt or claim on any evidence that he or they think sufficient;

### Powers of trustees of renewable leaseholds to renew and raise money for the purpose

20\.—(1) A trustee of any leaseholds for lives or years which are renewable from time to time either under any covenant or contract, or by custom or usual practice, may, if he thinks fit, and shall, if thereto required by any person having any beneficial interest, present or future, or contingent, in the leaseholds, use his best endeavours to obtain from time to time a renewed lease of the same hereditaments on the accustomed and reasonable terms, and for that purpose may, from time to time, make or concur in making a surrender of the lease for the time being subsisting, and do all such other acts as are requisite:

Provided that, where by the terms of the settlement or will the person in possession for his life or other limited interest is entitled to enjoy the same without any obligation to renew or to contribute to the expense of renewal, this section shall not apply unless the consent in writing of that person is obtained to the renewal on the part of the trustee.

(2) If money is required to pay for the renewal, the trustee effecting the renewal may pay the same out of any money then in his hands in trust for the persons beneficially interested in the lands to be comprised in the renewed lease, and if he has not in his hands sufficient money for the purpose he may raise the money required by mortgage of the hereditaments to be comprised in the renewed lease or of any other hereditaments for the time being subject to the uses or trusts to which those hereditaments are subject, and no person advancing money upon a mortgage purporting to be under this power shall be bound to see that the money is wanted, or that no more is raised than is wanted for the purpose, or otherwise as to the application thereof.

### Power to raise money by sale, mortgage, etc.

21\.—(1) Where trustees are authorised by the instrument, if any, creating the trust or by law to pay or apply capital money subject to the trust for any purpose or in any manner, they shall have and shall be deemed always to have had power to raise the money required by sale, conversion, calling in, or mortgage of all or any part of the trust property for the time being in possession.

(2) This section shall apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, but shall not apply to trustees of property held for charitable purposes.

(2) This section shall not apply to any building or property which a trustee is bound forthwith to convey absolutely to any beneficiary upon being requested to do so.

### Application of insurance money where policy kept up under any trust, power or obligation

25\.—(1) Money receivable by trustees or any beneficiary under a policy of insurance against the loss or damage of any property, subject to a trust, whether by fire or otherwise, shall, where the policy has been kept up under any trust in that behalf or under any power statutory or otherwise, or in the performance of any covenant or of any obligation statutory or otherwise, or by a tenant for life impeachable for waste, be capital money for the purpose of the trust.

(2) If any such money is receivable by any person, other than the trustees of the trust, that person shall use his best endeavours to recover and receive the money, and shall pay the net residue thereof after discharging any costs of recovering and receiving it, to the trustees of the trust, or, if there are no trustees capable of giving a discharge therefor, into court.

(3) Any such money —

(a) if it was receivable in respect of property held upon trust for sale, shall be held upon the trusts and subject to the powers and provisions applicable to money arising by a sale under such trust; and

(b) in any other case, shall be held upon trusts corresponding as nearly as may be with the trusts affecting the property in respect of which it was payable.

(4) Such money, or any part thereof, may also be applied by the trustees, or, if in court, under the direction of the court, in rebuilding, reinstating, replacing or repairing the property lost or damaged, but any such application by the trustees shall be subject to the consent of any person whose consent is required by the instrument, if any, creating the trust to the investment of money subject to the trust.

(5) Nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect the right of any person to require any such money or any part thereof to be applied in rebuilding, reinstating, replacing or repairing the property lost or damaged, or the right of any mortgagee, lessor or lessee, whether under any statute or otherwise.

Trustees may deposit any documents held by them, relating to the trust or to the trust property, with any banker or banking company or any other company whose business includes the undertaking of the safe custody of documents, and any sum payable in respect of such deposit shall be paid out of the income of the trust property.

### Reversionary interests, valuations and audit

27\.—(1) Where trust property includes any share or interest in property not vested in the trustees, or the proceeds of the sale of any such property, or any other thing in action, the trustees on the same falling into possession, or becoming payable or transferable, may —

(a) agree or ascertain the amount or value thereof or any part thereof in such manner as they may think fit;

(a) to apply for any stop or other like order upon any securities or other property out of or on which such share or interest or other thing in action as aforesaid is derived, payable or charged; or

(b) to take any proceedings on account of any act, default or neglect on the part of the persons in whom such securities or other property or any of them or any part thereof are for the time being, or had at any time been, vested,

unless required in writing to do so by some person, or the guardian of some person, beneficially interested under the trust, and unless also due provision is made to their satisfaction for payment of the costs of any proceedings required to be taken:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall relieve the trustees of the obligation to get in and obtain payment or transfer of such share or interest or other thing in action on the same falling into possession.

(3) Trustees may, for the purpose of giving effect to the trust, or any of the provisions of the instrument, if any, creating the trust or of any statute, from time to time (by duly qualified agents) ascertain and fix the value of any trust property in such manner as they think proper and any valuation so made in good faith shall be binding upon all persons interested under the trust.

(4)1

1Compare section 22 of the Public Trustee Act (Cap. 260).

Trustees may, in their absolute discretion, from time to time, but not more than once in every year unless the nature of the trust or any special dealings with the trust property make a more frequent exercise of the right reasonable, cause the accounts of the trust property to be examined or audited by an independent accountant, and shall, for that purpose, produce such vouchers and give such information to him as he may require; and the costs of such examination or audit, including the fee of the auditor, shall be paid out of the capital or income of the trust property, or partly in one way and partly in the other as the trustees, in their absolute discretion, think fit, but, in default of any direction by the trustees to the contrary in any special case, costs attributable to capital shall be borne by capital and those attributable to income by income.

### Power to employ agents

28\.—(1) Trustees or personal representatives may, instead of acting personally, employ and pay an agent, whether a solicitor, banker, stockbroker or other person, to transact any business or do any act required to be transacted or done in the execution of the trust, or the administration of the testator’s or intestate’s estate, including the receipt and payment of money, and shall be entitled to be allowed and paid all charges and expenses so incurred, and shall not be responsible for the default of any such agent if employed in good faith.

(2) Trustees or personal representatives may appoint any person to act as their agent or attorney for the purpose of selling, converting, collecting, getting in, and executing and perfecting assurances of, or managing or cultivating, or otherwise administering any property, movable or immovable, subject to the trust or forming part of the testator’s or intestate’s estate, in any place outside Singapore or executing or exercising any discretion or trust or power vested in them in relation to any such property, with such ancillary powers, and with and subject to such provisions and restrictions as they may think fit, including a power to appoint substitutes, and shall not, by reason only of their having made such appointment, be responsible for any loss arising thereby.

(3) Without prejudice to such general power of appointing agents as aforesaid —

(a) a trustee may appoint a solicitor to be his agent to receive and give a discharge for any money or valuable consideration or property receivable by the trustees under the trust, by permitting the solicitor to have the custody of, and to produce, a deed having in the body thereof or endorsed thereon a receipt for such money or valuable consideration or property, the deed being executed, or the endorsed receipt being signed, by the person entitled to give a receipt for that consideration;

(b) a trustee shall not be chargeable with breach of trust by reason only of his having made or concurred in making any such appointment; and the production of any such deed by the solicitor shall have the same statutory validity and effect as if the person appointing the solicitor had not been a trustee;

(c) a trustee may appoint a banker or solicitor to be his agent to receive and give a discharge for any money payable to the trustee under or by virtue of a policy of insurance, by permitting the banker or solicitor to have the custody of and to produce the policy of insurance with a receipt signed by the trustee, and a trustee shall not be chargeable with a breach of trust by reason only of his having made or concurred in making any such appointment:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall exempt a trustee from any liability which he would have incurred if this Act and any previous written law relating to trustees had not been passed, in case he permits any such money, valuable consideration or property to remain in the hands or under the control of the banker or solicitor for a period longer than is reasonably necessary to enable the banker or solicitor, as the case may be, to pay or transfer the same to the trustee.

This subsection shall apply whether the money or valuable consideration or property was or is received before, on or after 1st September 1929.

### Power to concur with others

29\. Where an undivided share in the proceeds of sale of land directed to be sold, or in any other property, is subject to a trust, or forms part of the estate of a testator or intestate, the trustees or personal representatives may (without prejudice to the trust for sale affecting the entirety of the land and the powers of the trustees for sale in reference thereto) execute or exercise any trust or power vested in them in relation to such share in conjunction with the persons entitled to or having power in that behalf over the other share or shares, and notwithstanding that any one or more of the trustees or personal representatives may be entitled to or interested in any such other share, either in his or their own right or in a fiduciary capacity.

### Power to delegate trusts during absence abroad

30\.—(1) A trustee intending to remain out of Singapore for a period exceeding 14 days may, notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, by power of attorney, delegate to any person (including a trust corporation) the execution or exercise during his absence from Singapore of all or any trusts, powers and discretions vested in him as such trustee, either alone or jointly with any other person or persons:

Provided that a person being the only other co-trustee and not being a trust corporation shall not be appointed to be an attorney under this subsection.

(2) The donor of a power of attorney given under this section shall be liable for the acts or defaults of the donee in the same manner as if they were the acts or defaults of the donor.

(3) The power of attorney shall not come into operation unless the donor is out of Singapore and shall be revoked by his return.

(4) The power of attorney shall be attested by at least one witness, and shall be deposited in the Registry of the Supreme Court within 10 days after the execution thereof, or where not executed in Singapore within 10 days after its receipt in Singapore, with a statutory declaration by the donor that he intends to remain out of Singapore for a period exceeding 14 days from the date of the declaration, or from a date therein mentioned.

(5) The execution of any such instrument and statutory declaration shall be verified in such manner as is required by statute in the case of powers of attorney deposited in the Registry of the Supreme Court.

(6) The statutory declaration aforesaid and a statutory declaration by the donee of the power of attorney that the power has come into operation and has not been revoked by the return of the donor shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in favour of any person dealing with the donee.

(7) In favour of any person dealing with the donee, any act done or instrument executed by the donee shall, notwithstanding that the power has never come into operation or has become revoked by the act of the donor or by his death or otherwise, be as valid and effectual as if the donor were alive and of full capacity, and had himself done that act or executed that instrument, unless the person had actual notice that the power had never come into operation or of the revocation of the power before that act was done or instrument executed.

(8) For the purpose of executing or exercising the trusts or powers delegated to him, the donee may exercise any of the powers conferred on the donor as trustee by law or by the instrument creating the trust, including power, for the purpose of the transfer of any inscribed stock, himself to delegate to an attorney power to transfer but not including the power of delegation conferred by this section.

(9) The fact that it appears from any power of attorney given under this section, or from any evidence required for the purposes of any such power of attorney or otherwise, that in dealing with any stock the donee of the power is acting in the execution of a trust shall not be deemed for any purpose to affect any person in whose books the stock is inscribed or registered with any notice of the trust.

(10) No power of attorney shall be operative for the purposes of this section for a longer period than 18 months after the date of execution.

(c) any indemnity given in respect of any rent, covenant or agreement referred to in paragraph (a) or (b),

satisfies all liabilities under the lease or grant which may have accrued and been claimed, up to the date of the conveyance hereinafter mentioned, and, where necessary, sets apart a sufficient fund to answer any future claim that may be made in respect of any fixed and ascertained sum which the lessee or grantee agreed to lay out on the property demised or granted, although the period for laying out the same may not have arrived, then and in any such case the personal representative or trustee may convey the property demised or granted to a purchaser, legatee, devisee, or other person entitled to call for a conveyance thereof and thereafter —

(i) he may distribute the residuary estate of the deceased testator or intestate, or, as the case may be, the trust estate (other than the fund, if any, set apart as aforesaid) to or amongst the persons entitled thereto, without appropriating any part, or any further part, as the case may be, of the estate of the deceased or of the trust estate to meet any future liability under the said lease or grant;

(ii) notwithstanding such distribution, he shall not be personally liable in respect of any subsequent claim under the said lease or grant.

(2) This section shall operate without prejudice to the right of the lessor or grantor, or the persons deriving title under the lessor or grantor, to follow the assets of the deceased or the trust property into the hands of the persons amongst whom the same may have been respectively distributed, and shall apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the will or other instrument, if any, creating the trust.

### Protection by means of advertisement

32\.—(1) With a view to the conveyance to or distribution among the persons entitled to any movable or immovable property, the trustees or personal representatives may give notice by advertisement in theGazette, and such other like notices, including notices elsewhere than in Singapore, as would, in any special case, have been directed by a court of competent jurisdiction in an action for administration, of their intention to make such conveyance or distribution as aforesaid and requiring any person interested to send to the trustees or personal representatives within the time, not being less than two months, fixed in the notice or, where more than one notice is given, in the last of the notices, particulars of his claim in respect of the property or any part thereof to which the notice relates.

(2) At the expiration of the time fixed by the notice the trustees or personal representatives may convey or distribute the property or any part thereof to which the notice relates, to or among the persons entitled thereto, having regard only to the claims whether formal or not, of which the trustees or personal representatives then had notice and shall not, as respects the property so conveyed or distributed, be liable to any person of whose claim the trustees or personal representatives have not had notice at the time of conveyance or distribution; but nothing in this section —

(a) shall prejudice the right of any person to follow the property, or any property representing the same, into the hands of any person, other than a purchaser, who may have received it; or

(b) shall free the trustees or personal representatives from any obligation to make searches similar to those which an intending purchaser would be advised to make or obtain.

(3) This section shall apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the will or other instrument, if any, creating the trust.

### Protection in regard to notice

33\. A trustee or personal representative acting for the purposes of more than one trust or estate shall not, in the absence of fraud, be affected by notice of any instrument, matter, fact or thing in relation to any particular trust or estate if he has obtained notice thereof merely by reason of his acting or having acted for the purposes of another trust or estate.

### Exoneration of trustees in respect of certain powers of attorney

34\. A trustee acting or paying money in good faith under or in pursuance of any power of attorney shall not be liable for any such act or payment by reason of the fact that at the time of the act or payment the person who gave the power of attorney was subject to any disability or bankrupt or dead, or had done or suffered some act or thing to avoid the power, if this fact was not known to the trustee at the time of his so acting or paying:

Provided that —

(a) nothing in this section shall affect the right of any person entitled to the money against the person to whom the payment is made;

(b) the person so entitled shall have the same remedy against the person to whom the payment is made as he would have had against the trustee.

### Implied indemnity of trustees

35\.—(1) A trustee shall be chargeable only for money and securities actually received by him notwithstanding his signing any receipt for the sake of conformity, and shall be answerable and accountable only for his own acts, receipts, neglects or defaults, and not for those of any other trustee, or of any banker, broker or other person with whom any trust money or securities may be deposited, nor for the insufficiency or deficiency of any securities, nor for any other loss, unless the same happens through his own wilful default.

(2) A trustee may reimburse himself or pay or discharge out of the trust premises all expenses incurred in or about the execution of the trusts or powers.

Maintenance, advancement and protective trusts

### Power to apply income for maintenance and to accumulate surplus income during a minority

36\.—(1) Where any property is held by trustees in trust for any person for any interest whatsoever, whether vested or contingent, then, subject to any prior interests or charges affecting the property —

(a) during the infancy of any such person, if his interest so long continues, the trustees may, at their sole discretion, pay to his parent or guardian, if any, or otherwise apply for or towards his maintenance, education or benefit, the whole or such part, if any, of the income of that property as may, in all the circumstances, be reasonable, whether or not there is —

(i) any other fund applicable to the same purpose; or

(ii) any person bound by law to provide for his maintenance or education; and

(b) if such person on attaining the age of 21 years has not a vested interest in such income, the trustees shall thenceforth pay the income of that property and of any accretion thereto under subsection (2) to him, until he either attains a vested interest therein or dies, or until failure of his interest:

Provided that, in deciding whether the whole or any part of the income of the property is during a minority to be paid or applied for the purposes aforesaid, the trustees shall have regard to the age of the infant and his requirements and generally to the circumstances of the case, and in particular to what other income, if any, is applicable for the same purposes; and where trustees have notice that the income of more than one fund is applicable for those purposes, then, so far as practicable, unless the entire income of the funds is paid or applied as aforesaid or the court otherwise directs, a proportionate part only of the income of each fund shall be so paid or applied.

(2) During the infancy of such person, if his interest so long continues, the trustees shall accumulate all the residue of that income in the way of compound interest by investing the same and the resulting income thereof from time to time in authorised investments, and shall hold those accumulations as follows:

(a) if any such person —

(i) attains the age of 21 years, or marries under that age, and his interest in such income during his infancy or until his marriage is a vested interest; or

(ii) on attaining the age of 21 years or on marriage under that age becomes entitled to the property from which such income arose in fee simple, absolute or determinable, or under a grant issued under the State Lands Act [Cap. 314] or absolutely,

the trustees shall hold the accumulations in trust for that person absolutely, and so that the receipt of that person after marriage, and though still an infant, shall be a good discharge; and

(b) in any other case the trustees shall, notwithstanding that such person had a vested interest in such income, hold the accumulations as an accretion to the capital of the property from which the accumulations arose, and as one fund with such capital for all purposes,

but the trustees may, at any time during the infancy of such person if his interest so long continues, apply those accumulations, or any part thereof, as if they were income arising in the then current year.

(3) This section shall apply in the case of a contingent interest only if the limitation or trust carries the intermediate income of the property, but it shall apply to a future or contingent legacy by the parent of, or a person standing in loco parentis to, the legatee, if and for such period as, under the general law, the legacy carries interest for the maintenance of the legatee, and in such latter case the rate of interest shall (if the income available is sufficient and subject to any Rules of Court to the contrary) be $5 per centum per annum.

(4) This section shall apply to a vested annuity in like manner as if the annuity were the income of property held by trustees in trust to pay the income thereof to the annuitant for the same period for which the annuity is payable, save that in any case accumulations made during the infancy of the annuitant shall be held in trust for the annuitant or his personal representatives absolutely.

(5) This section shall not apply where the instrument, if any, under which the interest arises came into operation before 1st September 1929.

### Power of advancement

37\.—(1) Trustees may at any time or times pay or apply any capital money subject to a trust, for the advancement or benefit in such manner as they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit, of any person entitled to the capital of the trust property or of any share thereof, whether absolutely or contingently on his attaining any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, or subject to a gift over on his death under any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, and whether in possession or in remainder or reversion, and such payment or application may be made notwithstanding that the interest of such person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation, or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which he belongs:

Provided that —

(a) the money so paid or applied for the advancement or benefit of any person shall not exceed altogether in amount one-half of the presumptive or vested share or interest of that person in the trust property;

(b) if that person is or becomes absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to a share in the trust property the money so paid or applied shall be brought into account as part of such share; and

(c) no such payment or application shall be made so as to prejudice any person entitled to any prior life or other interest, whether vested or contingent, in the money paid or applied unless such person is in existence and of full age and consents in writing to such payment or application.

(2) This section shall not apply to trusts constituted or created before 1st September 1929.

### Protective trusts

38\.—(1) Where any income, including an annuity or other periodical income payment, is directed to be held on protective trusts for the benefit of any person (referred to in this section as the principal beneficiary) for the period of his life or for any less period, then, during the period (referred to in this section as the trust period) the said income shall, without prejudice to any prior interest, be held on the following trusts:

(a) upon trust for the principal beneficiary during the trust period or until he, whether before or after the termination of any prior interest, does or attempts to do or suffers any act or thing, or until any event happens, other than an advance under any statutory or express power, whereby, if the said income were payable during the trust period to the principal beneficiary absolutely during that period, he would be deprived of the right to receive the same or any part thereof, in any of which cases, as well as on the termination of the trust period, whichever first happens, this trust of the said income shall fail or determine;

(b) if the trust aforesaid fails or determines during the subsistence of the trust period, then, during the residue of that period, the said income shall be held upon trust for the application thereof for the maintenance or support, or otherwise for the benefit, of all or any one or more exclusively of the other or others of the following persons:

(i) the principal beneficiary and his or her wife or husband, if any, and his or her children or more remote issue, if any; or

(ii) if there is no wife or husband or issue of the principal beneficiary in existence, the principal beneficiary and the persons who would, if he were actually dead, be entitled to the trust property or the income thereof or to the annuity fund, if any, or arrears of the annuity, as the case may be,

 as the trustees in their absolute discretion, without being liable to account for the exercise of such discretion, think fit.

(2) This section shall not apply to trusts coming into operation before 1st September 1929 and has effect subject to any variation of the implied trusts aforesaid contained in the instrument creating the trust.

(3) Nothing in this section shall operate to validate any trust which would, if contained in the instrument creating the trust, be liable to be set aside.

(a) the person or persons nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees by the instrument, if any, creating the trust; or

(2) Where a trustee has been removed under a power contained in the instrument creating the trust, a new trustee or new trustees may be appointed in the place of the trustee who is removed, as if he were dead, or, in the case of a corporation, as if the corporation desired to be discharged from the trust, and this section shall apply accordingly, but subject to the restrictions imposed by this Act on the number of trustees.

(3) Where a corporation being a trustee is or has been dissolved, either before, on or after 1st September 1929, then, for the purposes of this section and of any written law replaced thereby, the corporation shall be deemed to be and to have been from the date of the dissolution incapable of acting in the trusts or powers reposed in or conferred on the corporation.

(4) The power of appointment given by subsection (1) or any similar previous written law to the personal representatives of a last surviving or continuing trustee shall be and shall be deemed always to have been exercisable by the executors for the time being (whether original or by representation) of such surviving or continuing trustee who have proved the will of their testator or by the administrators for the time being of such trustee without the concurrence of any executor who has renounced or has not proved.

(5) But a sole or last surviving executor intending to renounce, or all the executors where they all intend to renounce, shall have and shall be deemed always to have had power, at any time before renouncing probate, to exercise the power of appointment given by this section, or by any similar previous written law, if willing to act for that purpose and without thereby accepting the office of executor.

(6) Where a sole trustee, other than a trust corporation, is or has been originally appointed to act in a trust, or where, in the case of any trust, there are not more than 3 trustees (none of them being a trust corporation) either original or substituted and whether appointed by the court or otherwise, then and in any such case —

(a) the person or persons nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees by the instrument, if any, creating the trust; or

(b) if there is no such person, or no such person able and willing to act, then the trustee or trustees for the time being,

may, by writing, appoint another person or other persons to be an additional trustee or additional trustees, but it shall not be obligatory to appoint any additional trustee, unless the instrument, if any, creating the trust, or any written law provides to the contrary, nor shall the number of trustees be increased beyond 4 by virtue of any such appointment.

(7) Every new trustee appointed under this section, as well before as after all the trust property becomes by law, or by assurance, or otherwise, vested in him, shall have the same powers, authorities and discretions, and may in all respects acts as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.

## PART V

POWERS OF THE COURT

In particular and without prejudice to the generality of this subsection, the court may make an order appointing a new trustee in substitution for a trustee who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment or is a mentally disordered person or a person of unsound mind or is a bankrupt or is a corporation which is in liquidation or has been dissolved.

(2) An order made under this section, and any consequential vesting order or conveyance, shall not operate further or otherwise as a discharge to any former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees under any power for that purpose contained in any instrument would have operated.

(3) Nothing in this section shall give power to appoint an executor or administrator.

### Power to authorise remuneration

46\. The court may allow any trustee, other than the Public Trustee, such remuneration for his services as trustee as the court may think fit.

### Powers of new trustee appointed by the court

47\. Every trustee appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall, as well before as after the trust property becomes by law, or by assurance, or otherwise, vested in him, have the same powers, authorities and discretions, and may in all respects act as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.

Vesting orders

48\. In any of the following cases:

(a) where the court appoints or has appointed a trustee, or where a trustee has been appointed out of court under any statutory or express power;

(g) where a trustee jointly or solely entitled to or possessed of any interest in land, or entitled to a contingent right therein, has been required, by or on behalf of a person entitled to require a conveyance of the land or interest or a release of the right, to convey the land or interest or to release the right, and has wilfully refused or neglected to convey the land or interest or release the right for 28 days after the date of the requirement;

(h) where land or any interest therein is vested in a trustee whether by way of mortgage or otherwise and it appears to the court to be expedient,

the court may make an order (referred to in this Act as a vesting order) vesting the land or interest therein in any such person in any such manner and for any such estate or interest as the court may direct, or releasing or disposing of the contingent right to such person as the court may direct:

Provided that —

(i) where the order is consequential on the appointment of a trustee the land or interest therein shall be vested for such estate as the court may direct in the persons who on the appointment are the trustees; and

(ii) where the order relates to a trustee entitled or formerly entitled jointly with another person, and such trustee is under disability or out of the jurisdiction of the court or cannot be found, or being a corporation has been dissolved, the land, interest or right shall be vested in such other person who remains entitled, either alone or with any other person, as the court may appoint.

### Orders as to contingent rights of unborn persons

49\. Where any interest in land is subject to a contingent right in an unborn person or class of unborn persons who, on coming into existence would, in respect thereof, become entitled to or possessed of that interest on any trust, the court may make an order releasing the land or interest therein from the contingent right, or may make an order vesting in any person the estate or interest to or of which the unborn person or class of unborn persons would, on coming into existence, be entitled or possessed in the land.

### Vesting order in place of conveyance by infant mortgagee

50\. Where any person entitled to or possessed of any interest in land, or entitled to a contingent right in land, by way of security for money, is an infant, the court may make an order vesting or releasing or disposing of the interest in the land or the right in the like manner as in the case of a trustee under disability.

(a) that any of the parties to the action are trustees of any interest in the land or any part thereof within the meaning of this Act; or

(b) that the interests of unborn persons who might claim under any party to the action, or under the will or voluntary settlement of any deceased person who was during his lifetime a party to the contract or transaction concerning which the judgment is given, are the interests of persons who, on coming into existence, would be trustees within the meaning of this Act,

and thereupon the court may make a vesting order relating to the rights of those persons, born and unborn, as if they had been trustees.

### Effect of vesting order

53\. A vesting order made under this Act shall, in the case of a vesting order consequential on the appointment of a trustee, have the same effect —

(a) as if the persons who before the appointment were the trustees, if any, had duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for such estate or interest as the court directs; or

(b) if there is no such person, or no such person of full capacity, as if such person had existed and been of full capacity and had duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for such estate or interest as the court directs,

and shall in every other case have the same effect as if the trustee, mortgagee or other person or description or class of persons to whose rights or supposed rights the said provisions respectively relate had been an ascertained and existing person of full capacity, and had executed a conveyance or release to the effect intended by the order.

### Power to appoint person to convey

54\. In all cases where a vesting order can be made under this Act, the court may, if it is more convenient, appoint a person to convey the land or any interest therein or release the contingent right, and a conveyance or release by that person in conformity with the order shall have the same effect as an order under the appropriate provision.

(v) neglects or refuses to transfer stock or receive the dividends or income thereof, or to sue for or recover a thing in action for 28 days next after an order of the court for that purpose has been served on him,

(c) where it is uncertain whether a trustee entitled alone or jointly with another person to stock or to a thing in action is alive or dead;

(d) where stock is standing in the name of a deceased person whose personal representative is under disability;

(e) where stock or a thing in action is vested in a trustee whether by way of mortgage or otherwise and it appears to the court to be expedient,

the court may make an order vesting the right to transfer or call for a transfer of stock, or to receive the dividends or income thereof, or to sue for or recover the thing in action, in any such person as the court may appoint:

Provided that —

(i) where the order is consequential on the appointment of a trustee, the right shall be vested in the persons who, on the appointment, are the trustees, and

### Vesting orders of charity or society property

56\. The powers conferred by this Act as to vesting orders may be exercised for vesting any interest in land, stock or thing in action in any trustee of a charity or society over which the court would have jurisdiction upon action duly instituted, whether the appointment of the trustee was made by instrument under a power or by the court under its general or statutory jurisdiction.

### Vesting orders in relation to infant’s beneficial interest

57\. Where an infant is beneficially entitled to any property, the court may, with a view to the application of the capital or income thereof for the maintenance, education or benefit of the infant, make an order —

(a) appointing a person to convey the property; or

(b) in the case of stock, or a thing in action, vesting in any person the right to transfer or call for a transfer of the stock, or to receive the dividends or income thereof, or to sue for and recover such thing in action, upon such terms as the court may think fit.

### Orders made upon certain allegations to be conclusive evidence

58\. Where a vesting order is made as to any land under this Act founded on an allegation of any of the following matters:

(a) the personal incapacity of a trustee or mortgagee;

(b) that a trustee or mortgagee or the personal representative of or other person deriving title under a trustee or mortgagee is out of the jurisdiction of the court, or cannot be found, or being a corporation has been dissolved;

(c) that it is uncertain which of two or more trustees, or which of two or more persons interested in a mortgage, was the survivor;

(d) that it is uncertain whether the last trustee or the personal representative of or other person deriving title under a trustee or mortgagee, or the last surviving person interested in a mortgage is living or dead; or

(e) that any trustee or mortgagee has died intestate without leaving a person beneficially interested under the intestacy or has died and it is not known who is his personal representative or the person interested,

the fact that the order has been so made shall be conclusive evidence of the matter so alleged in any court upon any question as to the validity of the order; but this section does not prevent the court from directing a reconveyance or surrender or the payment of costs occasioned by any such order if improperly obtained.

Jurisdiction to make other order

### Power of court to authorise dealings with trust property

59\.—(1) Where in the management or administration of any property vested in trustees, any sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release, or other disposition, or any purchase, investment, acquisition, expenditure, or other transaction, is in the opinion of the court expedient, but the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument, if any, or by law, the court may by order confer upon the trustees, either generally or in any particular instance, the necessary power for the purpose, on such terms, and subject to such provisions and conditions, if any, as the court may think fit and may direct in what manner any money authorised to be expended, and the costs of any transaction, are to be paid or borne as between capital and income.

61\. Where in any action the court is satisfied that diligent search has been made for any person who, in the character of trustee, is made a defendant in any action, to serve him with a process of the court, and that he cannot be found, the court may hear and determine the action and give judgment therein against that person in his character of a trustee as if he had been duly served, or had entered an appearance in the action, and had also appeared by his solicitor at the hearing, but without prejudice to any interest he may have in the matters in question in the action in any other character.

### Power to charge costs on trust estate

62\. The court may order the costs and expenses of and incident to any application for an order appointing a new trustee, or for a vesting order, or of and incident to any such order, or any conveyance or transfer in pursuance thereof, to be raised and paid out of the property in respect whereof the same is made, or out of the income thereof, or to be borne and paid in such manner and by such persons as to the court may seem just.

### Power to relieve trustee from personal liability

63\. If it appears to the court that a trustee, whether appointed by the court or otherwise, is or may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before, on or after 1st September 1929, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which he committed the breach, then the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for the same.

### Power to make beneficiary indemnify for breach of trust

64\.—(1) Where a trustee commits a breach of trust at the instigation or request or with the consent in writing of a beneficiary, the court may, if it thinks fit, and notwithstanding that the beneficiary may be a married woman restrained from anticipation, make such order as to the court seems just, for impounding all or any part of the interest of the beneficiary in the trust estate by way of indemnity to the trustee or persons claiming through him.

(2) This section shall apply to breaches of trust committed as well before as on or after 1st September 1929.

Payment into court

### Payment into court by trustees

65\.—(1) Trustees, or the majority of trustees, having in their hands or under their control money or securities belonging to a trust, may pay the same into court; and the same shall, subject to the Rules of the Supreme Court, be dealt with according to the orders of the court.

(3) Where money or securities is or are vested in any persons as trustees, and the majority are desirous of paying the same into court, but the concurrence of the other or others cannot be obtained, the court may order the payment into court to be made by the majority without the concurrence of the other or others.

(4) Where any such money or securities is or are deposited with any banker, broker, or other depositary, the court may order payment or delivery of the money or securities to the majority of the trustees for the purpose of payment into court.
