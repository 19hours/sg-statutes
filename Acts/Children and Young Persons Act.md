(6) If in any case where the child or young person is not legally represented or assisted in his defence as provided for in subsection (5), the child or young person, instead of asking questions by way of cross-examination, makes assertions, the Juvenile Court shall then put to the witness such questions as it thinks necessary on behalf of the child or young person and may, for this purpose, question the child or young person in order to bring out or clear up any point arising out of those questions.

(7) If it appears to the Juvenile Court that a prima facie case is made out, the Court shall explain to the child or young person the substance of the evidence against him and, in particular, any points therein which specially tell against him or require explanation and the child or young person shall be allowed to give evidence upon oath or affirmation or to make a statement if he so desires and the evidence of any witness for the defence shall be heard.

(8) If the child or young person admits the offence or the Juvenile Court is satisfied that it is proved, he and his parent or guardian, if present, shall then be asked if they desire to say anything in extenuation or mitigation of the penalty or otherwise.
