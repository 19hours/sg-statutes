Any person to whose care a child or young person is committed under this Act shall, while the order is in force, have the like control over the child or young person as if he were the parent and shall be responsible for the maintenance of the child or young person, and the child or young person shall continue in the care of that person notwithstanding that he is claimed by his parents or any other person and if any person —

(a) knowingly assists or induces, directly or indirectly, a child or young person to escape from the person to whose care he is committed; or

(b) knowingly harbours, conceals or prevents from returning to that person, a child or young person who has so escaped or knowingly assists in so doing,

he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

### Contribution orders

25\.—(1) Where an order has been made by a protector under section 16 committing a child to a place of safety or to the custody of a relative or other fit person, the protector may at the time of or subsequent to the making of such order make a further order (referred to in this section as a protector’s contribution order) requiring the parent or guardian of the child or the person having the custody of the child at the time of the making of the order to contribute such weekly or monthly sum in respect of the child’s maintenance as the protector having regard to his means thinks fit, and it shall be the duty of the parent or guardian or other person to comply with the terms of a protector’s contribution order.

(2) No protector’s contribution order shall be made without giving the person ordered to make a contribution an opportunity to be heard.

(b) shall not be so varied as to increase any contribution payable thereunder without giving the person making the contribution an opportunity to be heard.

(4) If any person wilfully neglects to comply with a protector’s contribution order made under this section, a court may, for every breach of the order, by warrant direct the amount due to be levied in the manner by law provided for levying fines imposed by Magistrates, or may sentence the person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month for each month’s contribution remaining unpaid.

## PART III

JUVENILE COURTS

### General consideration

28\.—(1) Every court in dealing with a child or young person who is brought before it, either as being in need of care or protection, or as an offender or otherwise, shall have regard to the welfare of the child or young person and shall in a proper case take steps for removing him from undesirable surroundings, and for securing that proper provision is made for his education and training.

(2) A court shall not order a child below the age of 10 years to be sent to an approved school, a remand home or place of detention unless for any reason, including the want of a fit person of his own religious persuasion who is willing to undertake the care of him, the court is satisfied that he cannot suitably be dealt with otherwise.

### Children and young persons not to associate with adult offenders

29\. No child or young person while detained in a police station or while being conveyed to or from any court, or while waiting before or after attending in any criminal court, shall be permitted to associate with an adult (not being a relative) who is charged with an offence other than an offence with which the child or young person is jointly charged.

### Bail of children and young persons arrested

30\. Where a person apparently below the age of 16 years is arrested with or without warrant, he shall be brought before a Juvenile Court; and where he cannot be brought forthwith before a Juvenile Court, the officer making the arrest shall, without unnecessary delay, take or send the person arrested before a Magistrate who shall inquire into the case and unless —

(a) the charge is one of an offence triable only by the High Court;

(b) it is necessary in the interest of that person to remove him from association with any undesirable person; or

(c) the Magistrate has reason to believe that the release of that person would defeat the ends of justice,

shall release that person on a bond, with or without sureties, for such amount as will, in the opinion of the Magistrate, secure the attendance of that person upon the hearing of the charge, being entered into by his parent or guardian or other responsible person.

### Parent or guardian may be required to attend Juvenile Court

31\. Where a child or young person is charged with any offence or is for any reason brought before a Juvenile Court, his parent or guardian may in any case, and shall if he can be found and resides within a reasonable distance, be required to attend at the Juvenile Court before which the case is heard or determined during all the stages of the proceedings, unless the Juvenile Court is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to require the attendance of the parent or guardian.

### Constitution of Juvenile Courts

32\.—(1) A Juvenile Court shall be presided over by a Magistrate nominated by the President.

(2) If at any time, by reason of illness or other emergency, the Magistrate nominated under subsection (1) is not available, any Magistrate, although not so nominated, may preside over a Juvenile Court.

(3) The presiding Magistrate, when determining the method of dealing with a child or young person in respect of whom a written report is obtained by the Juvenile Court regarding his background, family history, school record or such other matters, shall sit with two advisers from a panel of advisers nominated by the President except that where it appears that the Court cannot without adjournment be fully constituted and that an adjournment would be inexpedient in the interests of justice, he may sit with one adviser or he may sit alone.

(4) Except as modified or extended by this Act (Cap. 68), the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code shall apply to a Juvenile Court as if that Court were a Magistrate’s Court.

(b) a charge made jointly against a child or young person and a person who has attained the age of 16 years shall be heard by a court of appropriate jurisdiction other than a Juvenile Court; or

(c) where in the course of any proceedings before any court of appropriate jurisdiction other than a Juvenile Court, it appears that the person to whom the proceedings relate is a child or young person, nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the court, if it thinks fit to do so, from proceeding with the hearing and determination of the proceedings.

(2) A Juvenile Court shall have jurisdiction to try all offences which, but for subsection (1), would be triable only by a Magistrate’s Court or a District Court.

(3) A person who has attained the age of 16 years on the date of commencement of the hearing of the charge shall not be tried for any offence by a Juvenile Court but where in the course of any trial before a Juvenile Court the child or young person to whom the trial relates attains the age of 16 years, nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Court from proceeding, if it thinks fit, with the trial.

(4) Where on the commencement of this Act, a trial relating to a person who has attained the age of 16 years has commenced before a Juvenile Court, the Court may proceed, if it thinks fit, with the trial.

34\.—(1) A Juvenile Court shall sit as often as may be necessary for the purpose of exercising any jurisdiction conferred on it by this or any other Act.

(2) A Juvenile Court shall sit either in a different building or room from that in which sittings of courts other than Juvenile Courts are held, or on different days from those on which sittings of the other courts are held, and no person shall be present at any sitting of a Juvenile Court except —

35\.—(1) No newspaper report of any proceedings in a Juvenile Court shall reveal the name, address or school, or include any particulars calculated to lead to the identification of any child or young person concerned in those proceedings, either as being the person against, or in respect of whom, the proceedings are taken, or as being a witness therein, nor shall any picture be published in any newspaper as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in any such proceedings except that the Court or the Minister may in any case, if satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so, by order dispense with the requirements of this section to such extent as may be specified in the order.

(2) Any person who publishes any matter in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000.

37\.—(1) A child shall not be sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned for any offence or be committed to prison in default of payment of a fine or costs.

### Punishment of certain grave crimes

38\.—(1) Where a child or young person is convicted of murder, or of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, or of attempted murder, or of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, and the court is of opinion that none of the other methods by which the case may legally be dealt with is suitable, the court may sentence the offender to be detained for such period as may be specified in the sentence and where such a sentence has been passed, the child or young person shall, during that period, notwithstanding anything in the other provisions of this Act, be liable to be detained in such place and on such conditions as the Minister may direct.

(2) A person detained in pursuance of the directions of the Minister under this section shall, while so detained, be deemed to be in legal custody.

(4) Where a licence has been revoked, the person to whom the licence related shall return to such place as the Minister may direct, and if he fails to do so he may be apprehended without warrant and taken to that place.

### Power to order parent or guardian to pay fine, etc., instead of child or young person

39\.—(1) Where a child or young person is charged before a Juvenile Court with any offence for the commission of which a fine may be imposed and damages or costs or both may be awarded, and the Court is of the opinion that the case would be best met by the imposition of all or any of those penalties whether with or without any other punishment, the Court may, in such case, and shall, if the offender is a child, order that the fine imposed and damages or costs awarded be paid by the parent or guardian of the child or young person, unless the Court is satisfied that the parent or guardian cannot be found or that he has not conduced to the commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care of the child or young person.

(2) Where a child or young person is charged with any offence, a Juvenile Court may order his parent or guardian to give security for his good behaviour.

(3) Where a Juvenile Court thinks that a charge against a child or young person is proved, the Court may make an order on the parent or guardian under this section for the payment of damages or costs or requiring him to give security for the good behaviour of the child or young person, without proceeding to record a finding of guilt against the child or young person.

(4) An order under this section may be made against a parent or guardian who, having been required to attend, has failed to do so, but, subject to subsection (1), no such order shall be made without giving the parent or guardian an opportunity to be heard.

(5) Any sum imposed and ordered to be paid by the parent or guardian under this section, or on forfeiture of any such security, may be recovered from him in the manner provided by the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) in like manner as if the order had been made on the conviction of the parent or guardian of the offence with which the child or young person was charged.

### Power of other courts to remit juvenile offenders to Juvenile Courts

40\.—(1) Any court by or before which a child or young person is found guilty of an offence may, if it thinks fit, remit the case to a Juvenile Court, and where any such case is so remitted, the offender shall be brought before a Juvenile Court accordingly, and the Juvenile Court may deal with him in any way in which it might have dealt with him if he had been tried and found guilty by the Juvenile Court.

(2) No appeal shall lie against an order of remission made under subsection (1) but nothing in this subsection shall affect any right of appeal against the verdict or finding on which such an order is founded, and a person aggrieved by the order of the Juvenile Court to which the case is remitted may appeal therefrom to the High Court as if he has been tried by, and had pleaded guilty before, the Juvenile Court.

(3) A court by which an order remitting a case to a Juvenile Court is made under this section may give such directions as appear to be necessary with respect to the custody of the offender or for his release on bail until he can be brought before a Juvenile Court, and shall cause to be transmitted to the Juvenile Court to which the case has been remitted a certificate setting out the nature of the offence and stating that the case has been remitted for the purpose of being dealt with under this section.

### Words “conviction” and “sentence” not to be used

41\. The words “conviction” and “sentence” shall cease to be used in relation to children and young persons dealt with by a Juvenile Court and any reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of a child or young person, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt or an order made upon such a finding, as the case may be.

### Procedure in Juvenile Courts

42\.—(1) Where a child or young person is brought before a Juvenile Court for any offence, it shall be the duty of the Court as soon as possible to explain to him in simple language suitable to his age and understanding the substance of the alleged offence.

(2) After explaining the substance of the alleged offence, the Juvenile Court shall ask the child or young person whether he admits the facts constituting the offence.

(3) If the child or young person does not admit the facts constituting the offence, the Juvenile Court shall then hear the evidence of the witnesses in support thereof. At the close of the evidence in chief of each witness, the witness may be cross-examined by or on behalf of the child or young person.

(4) The Juvenile Court shall, except in any case where the child or young person is legally represented, allow his parents or guardian or, in their absence, any relative or other responsible person to assist him in conducting his defence.

(5) If in any case where the child or young person is not legally represented or assisted in his defence as provided for in subsection (4), the child or young person, instead of asking questions by way of cross-examination, makes assertions, the Juvenile Court shall then put to the witness such questions as it thinks necessary on behalf of the child or young person and may for this purpose question the child or young person in order to bring out or clear up any point arising out of those questions.

(6) If it appears to the Juvenile Court that a prima facie case is made out, the Court shall explain to the child or young person the substance of the evidence against him and, in particular, any points therein which specially tell against him or require explanation and the child or young person shall be allowed to give evidence upon oath or affirmation or to make a statement if he so desires and the evidence of any witness for the defence shall be heard.

(7) If the child or young person admits the offence or the Juvenile Court is satisfied that it is proved, he and his parent or guardian, if present, shall then be asked if they desire to say anything in extenuation or mitigation of the penalty or otherwise.

(8) Before deciding how to deal with him, the Juvenile Court may obtain such information as to his general conduct, home surroundings, school record and medical history, as may enable it to deal with the case in the best interests of the child or young person, and may put to him any question arising out of such information.

(9) The information referred to in subsection (8) may include any written report of a probation officer, a welfare officer, a registered medical practitioner or any other person whom the Juvenile Court thinks fit to provide a report on the child, and may be received and considered by the Court without being read aloud.

(10) For the purpose of obtaining the information under subsection (8), or for special medical examination or observation, the Juvenile Court may from time to time release the child or young person on bail or remand him in a place of detention.

(11) Where the Juvenile Court has received and considered a written report of a probation officer, a welfare officer, a registered medical practitioner or any other person whom the Court thinks fit to provide a report on the child or young person —

(a) the child or young person shall be told the substance of any part of the report bearing on his character or conduct which the Court considers to be material to the manner in which he should be dealt with;

(b) the parent or guardian, if present, shall be told the substance of any part of the report which the Court considers to be material to the manner in which the child or young person should be dealt with and which has reference to his character or conduct, or the character, conduct, home surroundings, or health of the child or young person; and

(c) if the child or young person or his parent or guardian having been told the substance of any part of any such report desires to produce evidence with reference thereto, the Court, if it thinks the evidence material, shall adjourn the proceedings for the production of further evidence and shall, if necessary, require the attendance at the adjourned hearing of the person who made the report.

(12) If in any case the Juvenile Court considers it necessary in the interests of the child or young person, it may require the parent or guardian of the child or young person, as the case may be, to withdraw from the Court.

### Presumption as to age

43\.—(1) Where, in a charge for an offence triable under this Act, it is alleged that the person by whom the offence was committed was below or had attained any specified age, and he appears to the court to have been at the date of the commission of the alleged offence below or to have attained the specified age, as the case may be, he shall for the purposes of this Act be presumed at that date to have been below or to have attained that age, as the case may be, and any order made therein shall not be invalidated by any subsequent proof that the age has been incorrectly stated.

(2) Where the court is, or the police are, in doubt as to the exact age of the person by whom an offence is alleged to have been committed, the certificate of a Government Medical Officer to the effect that, in his opinion, the person has or has not attained a specified age may be given in evidence.

### Powers of Juvenile Courts on proof of offence

44\.—(1) Where a Juvenile Court is satisfied that an offence has been proved, or where the child or young person admits the facts constituting the offence, the Court shall, in addition to any other powers exercisable by virtue of this Act or any other written law for the time being in force, have power —

(a) to discharge the offender;

(b) to discharge the offender upon his entering into a bond to be of good behaviour and to comply with such order as may be imposed;

(j) where the offender is a male and has attained the age of 16 years and the Court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may order him to be brought before a District Court to be dealt with under section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68).

(2) Where a Juvenile Court is satisfied, on the representations of the manager of a place of detention, an approved school or an approved home, that a person ordered to be detained in the place of detention, approved school or approved home is of so unruly a character that he cannot be so detained, the Court may —

(a) order the person to be transferred to and detained in an approved school or in another approved school, as the case may be, which the Court considers more suitable for him and to be detained there for the whole or any part of the unexpired period of detention;

(b) where the person is a young person, order the person to be transferred to and detained in a Young Offenders Section for a period not exceeding 6 months;

(c) on completion of the period of detention in a Young Offenders Section ordered under paragraph (b), and on receipt of a satisfactory report of the person’s conduct from the Director of Prisons, order the person to be sent back to the place of detention, approved school or approved home, from which he had been transferred, to complete the unexpired period for which he had originally been sent to the place of detention, approved school or approved home;

(3) Where a person, having been transferred to, and detained in, a Young Offenders Section and sent back to a place of detention, an approved school or approved home pursuant to subsection (2)(b) and (c) is again brought before the Juvenile Court on the representation of the manager of the place of detention, approved school or approved home as being of so unruly a character as to make his detention in such place of detention, approved school or approved home undesirable, the Court may —

(a) where the person is a young person, order the person to be transferred to and detained in a Young Offenders Section for the unexpired portion of the period for which he was originally sent to such place of detention, approved school or approved home; or

(b) where the person is a male and has attained the age of 16 years and the Court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may order him to be brought before a District Court to be dealt with under section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68).
