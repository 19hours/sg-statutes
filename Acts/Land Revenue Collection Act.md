Provided that it shall be lawful for the Collector in his discretion to apply any such surplus or part thereof to the payment of any arrear together with fees and costs due in respect of any other land belonging to the same owner within Singapore and thereupon to take action as if a tender had been made under section 8.

### Application to Court in regard to notice of sale

18\.—(1) If any person interested in land in respect of which a notice of sale has been issued under section 6 disputes the propriety of that notice, he may apply to the High Court to stay the proceedings, and the Court after hearing the Collector and making such inquiry as may be necessary shall make such order as it thinks fit.

(2) The Court’s order shall be final.

### Power to annul sale

19\.—(1) The Commissioner of Lands may at any time before a sale under this Part has become final and conclusive upon proof to his satisfaction that the sale was had contrary to the provisions of this Part and that material irregularities occurred or that any proprietor or other person will suffer excessive hardship by reason of the sale, annul the sale by order in writing: Provided that no such order shall be made (or if made shall be cancelled) after the date of institution of proceedings in court for the annulment of the sale.

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall affect the title of any owner, mortgagee or lessee who has taken bona fide for valuable consideration from the purchaser, or of any persons claiming under that owner, mortgagee or lessee.

(2) No suit for damages against the State or against any officer thereof in respect of any sale had under this Act shall be maintained if it is instituted after the expiry of 3 months after the date of the sale except in the case of actual fraud to which any officer of the State employed in or about the sale is proved to be a party or unless it is proved that the sum for the recovery of which the sale was had was not in fact an arrear at the date of the sale.

### No sale to be called in question except on proof of substantial damage

22\.—(1) Subject to section 21, no sale had under this Act shall be annulled by the court nor shall any such sale give ground for any action for damages against the Government or any officer thereof except only upon the grounds of its having been made contrary to the provisions of this Act and then only upon proof that the plaintiff has sustained substantial injury by reason of the irregularity complained of, and no Collector selling land for the recovery of an arrear shall be deemed a trespasser nor shall the sale be deemed wrongful by reason of any such irregularity in the procedure but the defaulter shall be entitled to recover as special damages for the irregularity the difference between the price actually obtained and the price which, in the opinion of the court, would have been obtained at the Collector’s sale if there had been no irregularity and no more.

(2) If any sale under this Act is annulled by the court, the purchase money or deposit paid by the purchaser shall be refunded by the Government with interest at the rate of 6% per annum, and the purchaser shall have no further claim for compensation.

No claim to rebate or remission or deferment of payment of rent, unless the same has been allowed by the written authority of the Commissioner of Lands and no private demand or cause of action whatever held or supposed to be held against the Government by any defaulter shall bar or render void or voidable a sale under this Part, nor shall the plea that money belonging to the defaulter and sufficient to pay the arrear of rent due was in the Collector’s hands bar or render void or voidable such a sale unless that money stands in the defaulter’s name alone and without dispute and unless after application in due time made by the defaulter the Collector has neglected or refused on insufficient grounds to transfer it in payment of the arrear of rent due.

### Jurisdiction

24\. No suit for the annulment of a sale had under this Act or for damages against the State or any officer thereof in connection with any such sale shall be instituted otherwise than in the High Court.
