(b) proceedings may be taken on the settlement agreement as if the settlement agreement had been a judgment given in the District Court; and

(c) any amount (payable to a person) for which the settlement agreement is registered carries interest as if that amount was a judgment debt.

(4) Where a settlement agreement is registered in a District Court, any party to the settlement agreement may, within such period as may be prescribed by Rules of Court made under section 33, apply to a District Court to set aside the registration of the settlement agreement.

(5) A District Court hearing an application under subsection (4) may, if any condition in subsection (6) is satisfied —

(i) set aside the settlement agreement;

(ii) refer any specified employment dispute purportedly resolved by the settlement agreement for mediation under this Part (if the settlement agreement arose from a mediation under this Part) or for tripartite mediation to be conducted by an approved mediator (if the settlement agreement arose from a tripartite mediation conducted by an approved mediator), with or without the consent of the parties to the settlement agreement.

(ii) refuse to issue to the claimant a claim referral certificate in respect of all or any of the unresolved specified employment disputes referred by the District Court.

(8) In subsection (7), a specified employment dispute is unresolved if the dispute is not settled and is not withdrawn by the claimant.

(9) To avoid doubt, where a District Court sets aside under subsection (5)(b)(i) a settlement agreement, and refers under subsection (5)(b)(ii) any specified employment dispute purportedly resolved by the settlement agreement for tripartite mediation to be conducted by an approved mediator, section 30H(3) to (9) of the Industrial Relations Act (Cap. 136) applies to that dispute as it applies to a dispute which the Commissioner is notified of under section 30H(2) of that Act.

(b) where a tribunal orders a party to pay an amount of money under subsection (1)(a) and costs under subsection (1)(c), any money paid by the party is to be applied first to the payment of the amount under subsection (1)(a), and then to the payment of the costs under subsection (1)(c).

(6) Where a tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine a claim or any part of a claim, that claim or part (as the case may be) must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
