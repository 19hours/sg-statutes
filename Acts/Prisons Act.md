(2) Every such order issued from the Supreme Court may be signed by the Registrar of the Court, and if issued by a District Court may be signed by the Judge or Registrar thereof and if issued by any other court shall be signed by the Magistrate or Coroner, as the case may be.

### Prisoners of unsound mind

31\.—(1) Whenever a prisoner undergoing a sentence of imprisonment appears to the Minister on the certificate of a registered medical practitioner to be of unsound mind, the Minister may, by order in writing, setting forth the grounds of belief that the prisoner is of unsound mind, direct his removal to any mental hospital or other fit place of safe custody within Singapore, there to be kept and treated as the Minister directs until the expiration of the term of imprisonment ordered by the sentence, or if it is certified by a medical officer that it is necessary for the safety of the prisoner or of others that he should be detained under medical care and treatment, then until he is discharged according to law.

(2) When it appears to the Minister on the certificate of a registered medical practitioner that such prisoner has again become of sound mind, the Minister shall, by an order in writing, return him to the prison from where he was removed if his term of imprisonment has not expired, but if the term has expired shall direct him to be discharged.

(3) Section 40 of the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act [Cap. 178] shall apply to every person confined in a mental hospital under this section after the expiration of the term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced, and the time during which he is so confined shall be reckoned as part of such term.

### Removal of prisoners

32\.—(1) The Director may, by order in writing, remove all or any prisoners confined in any prison to another prison within Singapore, and it shall not be necessary in the order to designate any prisoner by name, but it shall be sufficient to describe the prisoner or prisoners by reference to their nationality or sentence, or by some other like general description.

(2) If the Minister is satisfied that a person serving a sentence of imprisonment is under 21 years of age and might with advantage be detained in a reformative training centre, he may, after consultation where practicable with the Judge or District Judge of the court which passed the sentence, authorise the Director to transfer him to a reformative training centre; and section 13(7) of the Criminal Procedure Code [Cap. 68] shall thereupon apply to him as if he had on the date of the transfer been sentenced to reformative training:

Provided that if on that date the unexpired term of his sentence is less than 3 years those provisions shall apply to him as if he had been sentenced to reformative training 3 years before the expiration of that term.

(3) If a person detained in a reformative training centre is reported to the Minister by the Visiting Justices to be incorrigible, or to be exercising a bad influence on the other inmates of the institution, the Minister may commute the unexpired part of the term for which that person is then liable to be detained in a reformative training centre to such term of imprisonment as the Minister may determine, not exceeding the said unexpired part; and for the purpose of this Act that person shall be treated as if he had been sentenced to imprisonment for that term.

### Illness of a prisoner

33\.—(1) In case of serious illness of a prisoner (other than a prisoner referred to in subsection (2)) confined in a prison in which there is not suitable accommodation for the prisoner, any Superintendent may, on the certificate of a medical officer, make an order for his removal to a Government hospital.

(2) Where a prisoner confined in a prison appears to the Minister on the certificate of a registered medical practitioner to be suffering from leprosy, the Minister may, by order in writing, direct his removal to any hospital or place specified by the Director of Medical Services under section 8(2) of the Infectious Diseases Act [Cap. 137], there to be kept and treated until cured of his leprosy.

(3) So long as any prisoner who shall have been removed to any hospital or place under subsection (2) shall remain therein, the medical officer thereof shall, at the end of every month, transmit to the Superintendent of the prison a certificate signed by him that it is in his opinion necessary that he should remain in the hospital or place.

(4) In this section, “Government hospital” includes any hospital which the Minister may, by notification in theGazette, declare to be a hospital for the purposes of this section.

### Return to prison

34\. So soon as, in the opinion of the medical officer in charge of any hospital or place specified by the Director of Medical Services under section 8(2) of the Infectious Diseases Act, it is no longer necessary that any prisoner who shall have been removed to the hospital or place should remain therein, he shall transmit to the Superintendent a certificate, stating that such necessity has ceased, and thereupon the Superintendent shall forthwith cause the prisoner to be brought back to the prison if he is still liable to be confined therein.

### Liability for escape

35\. If any prisoner escapes during such time as he is in any hospital, mental hospital or place as aforesaid, no prison officer shall be held answerable therefor, unless the prisoner has been in the personal custody of that officer.

### Duty to prevent escape

36\. Every precaution shall be taken by the medical officers and other officers of any hospital, mental hospital or place to prevent the escape of prisoners who may at any time be under treatment therein, and it shall be lawful for the said officers to take such measures for preventing the escape of any prisoners as shall be necessary, provided that nothing shall be done under the authority hereof which in the opinion of the medical officers is likely to be prejudicial to the health of those prisoners.

### Special custody in hospital

37\. Where in any case, from the gravity of the offence for which any prisoner may be in custody or for any other reason, the Superintendent considers it to be desirable to take special measures for the security of the prisoner while under treatment in a hospital, mental hospital or place, it shall be lawful for him to give the prisoner into the charge of fit and proper persons not being less than two in number, one of whom at the least shall always be with the prisoner day and night, and such persons shall be vested with full power and authority to do all things necessary to prevent the prisoner from escaping, and shall be answerable for his safe custody until such time as he is handed over to a prison officer on his discharge from the hospital, mental hospital or place or until such time as his sentence expires, whichever may first occur.

### Saving of powers of High Court

38\. Nothing in this Act contained shall be held to lessen or affect the power of the High Court to direct persons confined in Singapore to be brought before the Court by writ of habeas corpus.

## PART V
