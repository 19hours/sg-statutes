(6) Any provision in any existing contract, agreement, conveyance, deed, lease, guarantee, bond, indemnity or other instrument or undertaking, to which the Authority is a party or may be bound, prohibiting or having the effect of prohibiting the transfer of any property, asset, interest, right, privilege, debt, liability or obligation transferred to the Commission under this section shall be deemed by this Act to have been waived.

### Transfer of employees

24\.—(1) On the transfer date, such persons or categories of persons as the Minister may determine and employed by the Authority immediately before that date in the transferred Division shall be transferred to the service of the Commission on terms no less favourable than those enjoyed by them immediately prior to their transfer.

(2) If any question arises as to whether any person has been transferred to the service of the Commission under subsection (1), a certificate under the hand of the Minister shall be conclusive evidence that the person was or was not so transferred.

(3) Until such time as terms and conditions of service are drawn up by the Commission, the scheme and terms and conditions of service in the Authority shall continue to apply to a transferred employee as if he were still in the service of the Authority.

(5) All deeds, schemes, bonds, agreements, instruments and arrangements subsisting immediately before the transfer date to which the Authority is a party and relating to a transferred employee shall have effect and shall be enforceable by or against the Commission as from that date as if —

(b) for any reference to the Authority therein there were substituted in respect of anything to be done on or after the transfer date a reference to the Commission.

(6) Where, on the transfer date —

(a) any disciplinary proceedings were pending against any transferred employee, the proceedings shall be carried on and completed by the Commission; and

(b) any matter concerning any transferred employee was in the course of being heard or investigated or had been heard or investigated by a committee of the Authority acting under due authority but no order, ruling or direction had been made thereon, the committee shall complete the hearing or investigation and shall make such order, ruling or direction as it could have made under the authority vested in it before that date,

and any order, ruling or direction made by such a committee pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as an order, a ruling or a direction of the Commission and have the same force and effect as if it had been made by the Commission pursuant to the authority vested in the Commission under this Act.

(7) The Commission may reprimand, reduce in rank, retire, dismiss or punish in some other manner any transferred employee for any misconduct or neglect of duty committed before the transfer date which would have rendered him liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished in some other manner if he had continued to be in the employment of the Authority and if this section had not been enacted.

(8) Any proceedings or cause of action pending or existing immediately before the transfer date by or against the Authority, or any person acting on its behalf, relating to any transferred employee may be continued and enforced by or against the Commission.

(9) For the avoidance of doubt, section 18A of the Employment Act (Cap. 91) shall not apply to the transfer under this section of any employee of the Authority to the Commission.
