# Jewish Synagogue Ordinance

(CHAPTER 365)

(Original Enactment: Ordinance 1 of 1878)

REVISED EDITION 1985

(30th March 1987)

An Ordinance to empower the Trustees of the Jewish Synagogue in Singapore to sell certain property, and for other purposes.\*

\*Note:This private Ordinance is reproduced in the form it appears in the 1955 Revised Edition

[29th March 1878]

Whereas by an Indenture of Lease dated the first day of September, 1841, the late Government of these Settlements demised on a pepper-corn rent a certain piece of land situated in Synagogue Street, in Singapore Town, estimated to contain 503.07 square metres, to Joseph Dewk Cohen, Nassim Joseph Ezra, and Ezra Ezra Ezekiel, their successors, representatives and assigns, as trustees for the Jewish inhabitants of Singapore for the purpose of erecting and maintaining thereon for the use of the Jewish inhabitants a synagogue or place of Divine worship, with a proviso that the said piece of land should be resumed by Government in the event of the same being appropriated for any other purpose than that of Divine worship:

And Whereas a synagogue has been erected and maintained on the said piece of land till the present time; and whereas Nassim Joseph Ezra and Ezra Ezra Ezekiel have since died; and Joseph Dewk Cohen being advanced in years, and having long left Singapore, did by a deed dated at Aleppo, in the Turkish Dominions, on the second day of February, 1876, appoint Abraham Solomon, Joshua Raphael Joshua, Ezra Abraham Solomon, Salleh Menasseh and Menasseh Meyer to be trustees of the said piece of land and synagogue, and did assign to them the said Government lease for the purpose of the said trust:

And Whereas the said Abraham Solomon is aged and infirm, and desires to be relieved from the said trust; and whereas the other four trustees so appointed, namely Joshua Raphael Joshua, Ezra Abraham Solomon, Salleh Menasseh and Menasseh Meyer are willing to continue to act as trustees with Reuben Meyer, Sassoon Aaron Gubbay and David Aaron Gubbay, who have been requested by the Jewish community of Singapore to act as trustees with them:

And Whereas the place on which the synagogue stands on the said piece of land in Synagogue Street, Singapore Town, which synagogue has hitherto been used by the Jewish inhabitants of Singapore as a place of Divine worship, has from various causes become unfit for a place of Divine worship, and it is desirable that another synagogue should be erected in a more convenient place; and as doubts exist as to whether the said piece of land can be sold to advantage under the present title, and it is expedient for the purposes of religion that the said piece of land should be sold to the best advantage, and that the proceeds of sale thereof should be applied to the erection of a synagogue in a more suitable place:

It is hereby enacted by the Governor of the Straits Settlements with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council thereof as follows:
