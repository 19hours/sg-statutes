(c) where paragraph (a) or (b) is contravened, the VCC must procure the disposal of the excess shares by its subsidiary, in accordance with section 24 before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the day on which that contravention occurs, or such further period as the Registrar may allow;

“

Where any certification by a VCC of an instrument of transfer of shares, debentures or other interests in the VCC is expressed to be limited to 42 days or any longer period from the date of certification, the VCC and its officers are not (in the absence of fraud) liable in respect of the registration of any transfer comprised in the certification after the expiry of the period so limited or any extension of the period given by the VCC, if the instrument has not within that period been lodged with the VCC for registration.

(b) the collective investment schemes of the foreign corporate entity are treated as sub-funds of an umbrella VCC and all provisions of this Act pertaining to sub-funds apply with such adaptations, exceptions and modifications as may be specified in the regulations; and

(c) if the foreign corporate entity was registered as a foreign company under Division 2 of Part XI of the Companies Act immediately before that date, it ceases to be so registered under Division 2 of that Part despite anything under that Act.

(2) To avoid doubt, the registration of a foreign corporate entity does not —

(a) create a new legal entity;

(b) prejudice or affect the identity of the body corporate constituted by the foreign corporate entity, or its continuity as a body corporate;

(c) affect the property, or the rights or obligations, of the foreign corporate entity; or

(d) render defective any legal proceedings by or against the foreign corporate entity,

and any legal proceedings that could have been continued or commenced by or against the foreign corporate entity before its registration may be continued or commenced by or against the VCC after the registration.

### Revocation of registration

138\.—(1) The Registrar may by order revoke the registration of a VCC if the VCC fails to comply with section 135(6).

(b) specify in the notice a period of at least 30 days within which the VCC may make written representations to the Registrar; and

(c) consider the VCC’s written representations (if any) that are received by the Registrar within the time specified in the notice.

(3) At the expiration of the time specified in the notice mentioned in subsection (2), the Registrar may, unless cause to the contrary is previously shown, order that the registration of the VCC be revoked.

(4) The Registrar must —

(b) serve a copy of the notice of the order of revocation on the VCC which registration is revoked.

(6) An order of revocation under subsection (3) is final.

(7) Despite the order of revocation in respect of a VCC under subsection (3), the liability, if any, of every officer and member of the VCC continues.

(8) Nothing in this section affects —

(a) the enforcement by any person of any right or claim against the VCC; or

(b) the enforcement by the VCC of any right or claim against any person,

whether such right or claim is enforced against, or by the VCC in its own right or in respect of any of its sub-funds.

### Duty of VCC to register pre-existing charges

139\.—(1) If, before the registration of a foreign corporate entity, there are any charges, whether created by the foreign corporate entity or otherwise, which would have been required to be registered under Division 8 of Part IV of the Companies Act (as applied by section 42) if the foreign corporate entity had been incorporated as a VCC under this Act, there must be lodged with the Registrar in the prescribed manner for registration, within 30 days after the date of registration of the VCC, a statement containing the prescribed particulars of the charge.

(2) Documents and particulars required to be lodged for registration under subsection (1) may be lodged by the VCC concerned or by any person interested in the documents.

(3) Where registration under subsection (1) is effected by some person other than the VCC concerned, that person is entitled to recover from the VCC the amount of any fees properly paid by him or her for the registration.

(4) If subsection (1) is contravened, the VCC and every officer of the VCC who is in default shall each be guilty of an offence and shall each be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and also to a default penalty.

(5) To avoid doubt, a failure to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the continuity of status, operation or effect of any security, right, priority or obligation of the charge.

(6) The Court, on being satisfied —

(a) that the omission to register a charge requiring registration under subsection (1), or that the omission or misstatement of any particular with respect to such charge, was accidental or due to inadvertence or to some other sufficient cause or is not of a nature to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders; or

(b) that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief,

may on the application of the VCC or any person interested and on such terms and conditions as seem to the Court just and expedient (including a term or condition that the rectification is to be without prejudice to any liability already incurred by the VCC or any of its officers in respect of the default) order that the time for registration be extended or that the omission or misstatement be rectified.

(7) In respect of any charge that is required to be lodged under subsection (1), sections 134, 135, 136 and 138 of the Companies Act (as applied by section 42) apply as if the charge were a charge to which Division 8 of Part IV of the Companies Act (as applied by section 42) applied.

### Duties of VCC with respect to issue of certificates

140\.—(1) Within 60 days after the date of registration of a VCC, the VCC must complete and have ready for delivery appropriate certificates in respect of all persons registered as holders of existing shares or debentures, as the case may be, as at the date of registration.

(2) Section 38(2) applies with the necessary modifications to the duty of the VCC under subsection (1).

(3) Upon the delivery of the certificates to the holders of existing shares or debentures under subsection (1), all prior certificates in respect of such shares or debentures cease to be operative and cease to have any validity for the purposes of this Act.

(4) Any share warrant, stating that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares specified in the warrant and enabling the shares to be transferred by delivery of the warrant, that had been issued by the foreign corporate entity before the date of registration of the VCC is void.

(5) If any VCC on which a notice has been served requiring the VCC to make good any default in complying with this section fails to make good the default within 10 days after the service of the notice, the Court may, on the application of the person entitled to have the certificates or the debentures delivered to him or her, make an order directing the VCC and any officer of the VCC to make good the default within such time as is specified in the order.

(6) An order under subsection (5) may provide that all costs of and incidental to the application are to be borne by the VCC or by any officer of the VCC in default in such proportions as the Court thinks fit.
