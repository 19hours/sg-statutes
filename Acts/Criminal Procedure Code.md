You have been charged with [or informed that you may be prosecuted for] —

Do you want to say anything about the charge that was just read to you?

(a) by seizure of such property which may be sold and the proceeds applied towards the payment of the amount of the bond; or

[Act 33 of 2012 wef 01/01/2013]

(3) If immovable property attached under subsection (2) is sold, the officer under whose direction the attachment and sale was carried out may do any thing or act to transfer the title to the purchaser.

(4) If the amount of the bond is not paid or cannot be recovered by such attachment and sale, the court may commit to prison the person bound by the bond for a term not exceeding 12 months.

(a) the fact of the remission order; and

Ais accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, criminal intimidation or using a false property mark. The charge may state, without referring to the definitions of those offences in the Penal Code, thatAcommitted murder or cheating or theft or extortion or criminal intimidation or that he used a false property mark, but the charge must refer to the section under which each offence is punishable.

(d)

Ais charged under section 184 of the Penal Code with intentionally obstructing a sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.

(a) the gross sum in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed; and

(b) the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed, which period shall not exceed 12 months,

without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence.

### When manner of committing offence must be stated

Only ifAwas actually misled by this omission may the error be regarded as material.

(b)

Ais charged with cheatingB. How he cheatedBis not stated in the charge or is stated incorrectly.Adefends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The court may infer from this that omitting to state, or stating incorrectly, howBwas cheated is not a material error.

(c)

Ais charged with cheatingB. How he cheatedBis not stated in the charge. There were many transactions betweenAandBandAhad no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred and offered no defence.

(2) If the accused declares that he is not ready, the court must duly consider any reason he gives.

(3) If the court thinks that proceeding immediately with the trial is unlikely to prejudice the accused’s defence or the prosecutor’s conduct of the case, then it may proceed with the trial.

(4) If the court thinks otherwise, then it may direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for as long as necessary.

### Stay of proceedings if altered or new charge requires Public Prosecutor’s consent

130\.—(1) If the offence stated in the altered or new charge is one that requires the Public Prosecutor’s consent under section 10(1), then the trial must not proceed before the consent is obtained, unless it has already been obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or new charge is based.

(2) If consent for the prosecution is or has been obtained, all evidence previously admitted by the court in the trial shall be deemed to have been admitted in evidence in the trial of the altered or new charge.

(8) If the court intends to impose a sentence of imprisonment without the option of a fine, it must require the accused to attend in person.

(9) If the accused wishes to withdraw his plea of guilty and claim trial when he appears pursuant to subsection (8), then the court must, notwithstanding any order of conviction made in his absence, permit him to withdraw his plea and then hear and determine the case, and if the court convicts him, pass sentence according to law.

“

I find that the prosecution has made out a case against you on the charge(s) on which you are being tried. There is some evidence, not inherently incredible, that satisfies each and every element of the charge(s). Accordingly, I call upon you to give evidence in your own defence.

You have two courses open to you. First, if you elect to give evidence you must give it from the witness box, on oath or affirmation, and be liable to cross-examination. Second, if you elect not to give evidence in the witness box, that is to say, remain silent, then I must tell you that the court in deciding whether you are guilty or not, may draw such inferences as appear proper from your refusal to give evidence, including inferences that may be adverse to you.

Let me also say, whichever course you take, it is open to you to call other evidence in your own defence. You may confer with your counsel on the course you wish to take.

I now call upon you to give evidence in your own defence. How do you elect?

(iii) where there are other co-accused persons, they and their witnesses shall then give evidence and be cross-examined and re-examined in like order;

## PART XIV

EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES

Division 1 —

Preliminary

### Interpretation of this Part

257\. In this Part, “statement” includes any representation of fact, whether made in words or otherwise.

Division 2 —

Admissibility of certain types of evidence

### Admissibility of accused’s statements

258\.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), where any person is charged with an offence, any statement made by the person, whether it is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after the person is charged and whether or not in the course of any investigation carried out by any law enforcement agency, is admissible in evidence at his trial; and if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit.

(2) Where a statement referred to in subsection (1) is made by any person to a police officer, no such statement shall be used in evidence if it is made to a police officer below the rank of sergeant.

(3) The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

Explanation1—If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible.

Explanations2—If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances:

(a) under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused for the purpose of obtaining it;

(aa) where the accused is informed in writing by a person in authority of the circumstances in section 33B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) under which life imprisonment may be imposed in lieu of death;

[Act 30 of 2012 wef 01/01/2013]

(b) when the accused was intoxicated;

(c) in answer to questions which the accused need not have answered whatever may have been the form of those questions;

(d) where the accused was not warned that he was not bound to make the statement and that evidence of it might be given against him; or

(e) where the recording officer or the interpreter of an accused’s statement recorded under section 22 or 23 did not fully comply with that section.

(4) If the statement referred to in subsection (3) is made after the impression caused by any such inducement, threat or promise referred to in that subsection has, in the opinion of the court, been fully removed, it shall be admissible.

(5) When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.

Explanation— —“Offence” as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.

Illustrations

(a)

AandBare jointly tried for the murder ofC. It is proved thatAsaid “Band I murderedC”. The court may consider the effect of this confession as againstB.

(b)

Ais on trial for the murder ofC. There is evidence to show thatCwas murdered byAandBand thatBsaid “Aand I murderedC”. This statement may not be taken into consideration by the court againstAasBis not being jointly tried.

(6) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section —

(a) where a person is charged with any offence in relation to the making or contents of any statement made by him to any officer of a law enforcement agency in the course of any investigation carried out by the agency, that statement may be used as evidence in the prosecution;

(b) any statement made by the accused in the course of an identification parade may be used as evidence; and

(c) when any fact or thing is discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of any officer of a law enforcement agency, so much of such information as relates distinctly to the fact or thing thereby discovered may be proved.

(7) In this section, “confession”, in relation to any person who is tried for an offence, means any statement made at any time by him stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.

### Witness’s statement inadmissible except in certain circumstances

259\.—(1) Any statement made by a person other than the accused in the course of any investigation by any law enforcement agency is inadmissible in evidence, except where the statement —

(a) is admitted under section 147 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97);

(b) is used for the purpose of impeaching his credit in the manner provided in section 157 of the Evidence Act;

(c) is made admissible as evidence in any criminal proceeding by virtue of any other provisions in this Code or the Evidence Act or any other written law;

(d) is made in the course of an identification parade; or

(e) falls within section 32(1)(a) of the Evidence Act.

[4/2012]

(2) Where any person is charged with any offence in relation to the making or contents of any statement made by him to an officer of a law enforcement agency in the course of an investigation carried out by that officer, that statement may be used as evidence in the prosecution.

### Admissibility of report on first information made under section 14 or 15

260\.—(1) In any proceeding under this Code, if a police officer of or above the rank of inspector certifies as a true copy a copy of a report received or recorded under section 14(2) or (3) or 15(1), or of a note made under section 14(5), the certified copy is admissible as evidence of the original information and of the date, time and place at which it was given.

### Inferences from accused’s silence

261\.—(1) Where in any criminal proceeding evidence is given that the accused on being charged with an offence, or informed by a police officer or any other person charged with the duty of investigating offences that he may be prosecuted for an offence, failed to mention any fact which he subsequently relies on in his defence, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, the court may in determining —

(a) whether to commit the accused for trial;

(b) whether there is a case to answer; and

(c) whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged,

draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which the failure is material.

(2) Subsection (1) does not —

(a) prejudice the admissibility in criminal proceedings of evidence of the silence or other reaction of the accused in the face of anything said in his presence relating to the conduct for which he is charged, in so far as evidence of this would be admissible apart from that subsection; or

(b) preclude the drawing of any inference from any such silence or other reaction of the accused which could be drawn apart from that subsection.

(a) the statement appears to be signed by the person who made it;

(b) the statement contains a declaration by the person to the effect that it is true to the best of his knowledge and belief and that he made the statement knowing that, if it were given in evidence, he would be liable to prosecution if he stated in it anything he knew to be false or did not believe to be true;

Division 3 —

Ancillary hearing

### Procedure to determine admissibility of evidence

279\.—(1) Subject to this Code and any other written law relating to the admissibility of evidence, where any party objects to the admissibility of any statement made by that party or any other evidence which the other party to the case intends to tender at any stage of the trial, the court must determine it separately at an ancillary hearing before continuing with the trial.

Illustrations

(a)

Evidence is to be given of a tape recording that is said to be of a conversation betweenXandY. There is an objection that the tape has been tampered with. The court must hold an ancillary hearing to determine its admissibility.

(b)

Xis accused of murderingYand disposing of the body by dismembering it. The prosecution seeks to offer evidence thatXwas involved in the murder ofZwhere similar dismemberment was done. The defence objects to the admission of such evidence. The court must hold an ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence.

(c)

The prosecution seeks to admit the statement of the accused. The accused alleges that the statement was given involuntarily as a result of a threat, inducement or promise. The court must hold an ancillary hearing to determine whether the statement was given voluntarily.

(d)

The prosecution seeks to admit a statement of the accused, who denies that he made it. No ancillary hearing is necessary as this does not relate to the voluntariness of the statement.

(e)

Xis accused of murderingY.Z, a good friend ofX, testifies thatXtold him that he had murderedY, which is denied byX. AsZis not a person in authority, no ancillary hearing is necessary as there is no issue of admissibility.

(2) In an ancillary hearing, any evidence adduced shall be limited only to the ancillary issue.

(3) The following procedure shall be complied with at an ancillary hearing:

(a) the party seeking to admit the evidence shall produce his evidence on the ancillary issue;

(b) the party must then examine his witnesses, if any, and each of them may in turn be cross-examined by the other party and every co-accused, as the case may be, after which the first party may re-examine them;

(c) after the party has concluded his case, the court shall call on the other party to present his evidence;

(d) when the other party is called on to present his evidence, the other party shall examine his witnesses, if any, and each of them may in turn be cross-examined by the first party and every co-accused, as the case may be, after which they may be re-examined;

(e) an accused may apply to the court to issue process for compelling the attendance of any witness and the production of any exhibit in court, whether or not the witness has previously been examined in the case, for the purpose of examination or cross-examination;

(f) the court must issue process unless it considers that the application made under paragraph (e) should be refused because it is frivolous or vexatious or made to delay or frustrate justice and in such a case the court must record the reasons for the order;

(g) before summoning any witness pursuant to an application under paragraph (e), the court may require that the reasonable expenses incurred by the witness in attending the trial be deposited in court by the defence;

(h) at the close of the other party’s case, whether or not evidence has been adduced in accordance with section 283, the first party shall have the right to call a person as a witness or recall and re-examine a person already examined, for the purpose of rebuttal, and such witness may be cross-examined by the other party and every co-accused, after which the first party may re-examine him;

(2) The court must summon and examine or recall and re-examine such a person if it thinks his evidence is essential to making a just decision in the case.

(3) The exercise by a court of its power under subsection (1) is not a ground for appeal, or for revision, unless the appellant, or the applicant, as the case may be, shows that the examination has led to a failure of justice.

### When person bound to give evidence intends to leave Singapore

284\.—(1) If a court is satisfied that any witness subject to a bond or is otherwise bound or about to be bound to give evidence in a trial intends to leave Singapore and that the ends of justice would probably be defeated if that person were not present at the trial to give evidence, it may, upon the application of the Public Prosecutor or accused, commit that person to prison until the trial or until he gives satisfactory security that he will give evidence at the trial, or complies with any other conditions that may be imposed by the court.

(2) Before making the order, the court must be satisfied that the party making the application has made adequate provision for the person’s maintenance and for compensating him for his detention and loss of time.

(b) alternatively —

(i) in the case of a previous conviction in Singapore, either by a certificate signed by the officer who has custody of the records of the prison in Singapore in which the punishment or any part of it was inflicted, or by production of the warrant of commitment under which the punishment was suffered; or

(ii) in the case of a previous conviction elsewhere, either by a certificate signed by the officer in charge of the prisons in that place in which the punishment or any part of it was inflicted, or by production of the warrant of commitment under which the punishment was suffered,

together with evidence as to the identity of the accused and the person so convicted or acquitted or against whom the order was made.

(2) The certificate referred to in subsection (1)(b) purporting to be signed by the officer who has custody of the records of the prison in Singapore or elsewhere shall be admitted in evidence on its production by the prosecution without proof of signature and, until the contrary is proved, shall be proof of all matters contained therein.

### Record of evidence in absence of accused

293\.—(1) If it is proved that an accused has absented himself so that there is no immediate prospect of arresting him, the court competent to try the accused may, in his absence, examine any witnesses produced on the prosecution’s behalf and record their depositions.

(2) These depositions may, on the arrest of the accused, be given in evidence against him at the committal hearing or trial for the relevant offence, if the deponent is dead or incapable of giving evidence or his attendance cannot be procured without unreasonable delay, expense or inconvenience.

(3) If it appears that an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for life has been committed by some person or persons unknown, a Magistrate’s Court may hold an inquiry and examine any witnesses who can give evidence concerning the offence.

(4) Any deposition so taken under subsection (3) may be given in evidence against any person who is subsequently accused of the offence if the deponent is dead or incapable of giving evidence or is outside Singapore.

(2) If the accused is in custody, a Judge or a Magistrate may order the officer in charge of the prison to, and the officer must, take the accused to the place and at the time notified.

(3) Where it is proved at the trial of the accused that the deponent is dead, or that he cannot attend for any sufficient reason, the deposition may be read even though the accused was absent when it was taken if the court trying the case is satisfied that —

(a) the deponent was at the time of his examination so dangerously ill as mentioned in subsection (1);

(b) the deposition was duly taken at the place and time notified; and

(c) reasonable notice of the intention to take it was given to the person against whom it is tendered in evidence so that he or his advocate might have been present and might have had, if he had chosen to be present, full opportunity of cross-examination.

### Taking of evidence before trial

295\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), where an application is made by the Public Prosecutor or the accused to a court for the evidence of a witness to be taken at any time before the date on which a criminal matter is fixed for trial, the court shall take the evidence of the witness appearing before it.

(2) An application under subsection (1) can only be made if it is shown with respect to the witness that it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance at the time fixed for the trial.

(3) The proceeding under this section must be conducted in the presence of the accused and co-accused, if any.

### Deposition of medical witness

296\. If the court is satisfied that grave inconvenience would otherwise be caused, it may, if it thinks fit, allow the deposition of a medical officer of the Government or other medical witness taken and attested by a Magistrate in the presence of the accused to be given in evidence in any trial under this Code, although the deponent is not called as a witness.

### Deposition of certain other witnesses

297\. Whenever at a committal hearing the evidence of any witness has been taken for the purpose of proving the custody or disposal of any matter or thing forwarded in the course of the inquiry to any public officer for examination or analysis or report, or of proving the custody or disposal of any instrument, weapon, matter or thing used in or for the commission of any offence, or of proving the accuracy of any plan or survey made or photograph taken by that witness for the purpose of the case, the High Court may, if it thinks fit, allow the deposition of that witness, taken and attested by an examining Magistrate in the presence of the accused to be given in evidence in any trial before the High Court although the deponent is not called as a witness.

## PART XV

JUDGMENT

### Mode of delivering judgment

298\.—(1) The court must deliver judgment in every criminal trial, criminal appeal, case stated, criminal revision, criminal reference or criminal motion in open court immediately after the trial, appeal, case stated, criminal revision, criminal reference or criminal motion, or at a later time of which due notice must be given to the parties or their advocates.

(2) A judgment must be delivered either orally or by written grounds of decision.

(3) Where a judgment is delivered by written grounds of decision, the judgment may be delivered by pronouncing the court’s decision with an oral summary of the written grounds, and giving a copy of the written grounds to the parties or their advocates either on the date of the court’s decision or at a later date.

(4) Where a trial judge had delivered judgment in any manner referred to in subsection (2), the trial judge may, at any time before the appeal is heard, give further grounds for his decision, which may include grounds other than the grounds of decision given earlier by the trial judge.

(5) Where an appellate court had delivered judgment orally, it may, at a later date, give in writing the grounds of its decision, which may include grounds other than the grounds of decision given earlier by the appellate court.

(6) Where the appellate court comprises more than one judge, it shall ordinarily give only one judgment, which may be delivered by the presiding judge or by such other member of the appellate court as the presiding judge may direct.

(7) Separate judgments shall be delivered if the presiding judge so directs.

(8) The judgment of any judge who is absent may be delivered by any other judge.

(9) If the accused is in custody, he must be produced before the court.

(10) If the accused is not in custody, he must attend to hear judgment delivered except when his personal attendance during the trial has been dispensed with and the sentence is one of fine only.

(11) Where the court reserves judgment in a trial, appeal, case stated, criminal revision, criminal reference or criminal motion, it may grant bail to the accused, with or without sureties, and on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit.

### Procedure after judgment of appellate court

299\.—(1) After hearing the appeal and delivering its judgment, the appellate court must certify its judgment, sentence or order to the trial court which recorded or passed the judgment, sentence or order appealed against.

(2) Where an appeal is not dismissed, the certificate must state the grounds on which the appellate court allowed the appeal or varied the trial court’s decision.

(3) The trial court must then make orders that conform to the appellate court’s judgment, sentence or order, and, if necessary, amend the record accordingly.

(4) If the appellate court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on a person who was not so sentenced by the trial court, the appellate court must by warrant commit that person to prison in addition to anything else it is required to do by this section and must certify accordingly to the trial court.

### Judgment in alternative

300\. When a person is found guilty of one of several possible offences under any written law, but it is doubtful which of those offences he is guilty of, the court must record a conviction in the alternative, distinctly specifying those offences, and the offender must be punished for the offence carrying the lowest punishment if the same punishment is not provided for all.

### Judgment not to be altered

301\.—(1) Where a court has delivered its judgment, it may rectify a clerical error at any time, and any other error, including an error in the exercise of its sentencing powers, may be rectified by the court by the next working day after the delivery of the judgment.

Illustrations

(a)

A Magistrate’s Court sentences an accused to 4 years’ imprisonment for an offence of theft under section 380 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224). In so far as a Magistrate’s Court may only impose an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years, the court had made an error. Such an error may be rectified by the court by the next working day after the delivery of the judgment.

(b)

Acommitted an offence under the Penal Code after the coming into force of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 51 of 2007). The Magistrate’s Court, however, imposed a sentence onAbased on the penalty provision in the Penal Code that was in force prior to the coming into force of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 when it should have sentencedAbased on the penalty provision as amended by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007. Such an error may be rectified by the court by the next working day after the delivery of the judgment.

(c)

A District Court imposes caning on a man who committed an offence when he was 54 years of age. In so far as section 325 of this Code prohibits the court from imposing caning on the man, the court had made an error. Such an error may be rectified by the court by the next working day after the delivery of the judgment.

(d)

A District Court sentences an accused to one year’s imprisonment for an offence of extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt under section 386 of the Penal Code. In so far as section 386 of that Code imposes a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of 2 years, the court had made an error. Such an error may be rectified by the court by the next working day after the delivery of the judgment.

(2) For the avoidance of doubt, any error resulting from a sentence imposed by a court which it subsequently views as being too harsh or too lenient is not such error within the meaning in subsection (1).

### Judgment to be filed with record

302\. The judgment must be entered on and, if written, filed with the record of proceedings.

the court may impose a sentence of reformative training in lieu of any other sentence if it is satisfied, having regard to his character, previous conduct and the circumstances of the offence, that to reform him and to prevent crime he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre.

[3/2011]

(2) Where a young person has been ordered by a Youth Court under the Children and Young Persons Act to be brought before a District Court, then the court must inquire into the circumstances of the case and may —
