(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), the court may apportion the use of goods and services between business use and non-business use as the court considers just and equitable in the circumstances of the case (notwithstanding that the goods or services are indivisible) and grant relief only in respect of the portion of goods and services so attributed with non-business use.

(8) For the purposes of subsections (6) and (7) and section 17, goods or services intended for business use shall include —

and “business use” and “non-business use” shall be construed accordingly.

(b) if it appears to the Court that, in the event that a declaration or an injunction is not granted, it is likely that the supplier will engage in the unfair practice, whether or not the supplier has previously engaged in the unfair practice and whether or not there is any likelihood of irreparable harm to any consumer or class of consumers if the supplier engages in the unfair practice.
