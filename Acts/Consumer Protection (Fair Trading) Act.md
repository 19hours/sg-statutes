(8) The court to which an application under subsection (7) has been made may, if the court is satisfied that the determination in respect of the application under section 9 will be material to the action under subsection (1), make an order, upon such terms as the court thinks fit, staying the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to that unfair practice.

[15/2008]

(9) Where no party to the proceedings has taken any further step in the proceedings for a period of 2 or more years after an order staying the proceedings has been made, the court may, on its own motion, make an order discontinuing the proceedings without prejudice to the right of any of the parties to apply for the discontinued proceedings to be reinstated.

(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), the court may apportion the use of goods and services between business use and non-business use as the court considers just and equitable in the circumstances of the case (notwithstanding that the goods or services are indivisible) and grant relief only in respect of the portion of goods and services so attributed with non-business use.

(8) For the purposes of subsections (6) and (7) and section 17, goods or services intended for business use shall include —

(a) goods or services (as the case may be) that the consumer intends to re-sell in the course of his business; and

and “business use” and “non-business use” shall be construed accordingly.

(a) payment for the goods or services;

(b) use of, dealing with or disposal of the goods or services;

(c) request to purchase another similar good or service; or

(d) inaction.

3.—(1) For the purpose of paragraph 24 of Part 1, “applicable agreement” means an agreement between a supplier and a consumer for the supply of goods or services which expressly provides that —
