(b) goods that the consumer intends to use up or transform, in the course of his business, in a process of production or manufacturing or in repairing or treating other goods or fixtures,

and “business use” and “non-business use” shall be construed accordingly.

(4) The court may proceed —

(a) as if the transferee had required the transferor to give effect to the other remedy; or

(b) if the other remedy is rescission under section 12D, as if the transferee had claimed to rescind the contract under that section.

(5) If the transferee has claimed to rescind the contract, the court may order that any reimbursement to the transferee be reduced to take account of the use he has had of the goods since they were delivered to him.

(6) The court may make an order under this section unconditionally or on such terms and conditions as to damages, payment for the goods and otherwise as it thinks just.
