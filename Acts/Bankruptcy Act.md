Schedule to be without prejudice to section 166

5.—(1) This Schedule shall be without prejudice to the power conferred by this Act under which rules under section 166 of this Act may make transitional provision in connection with the coming into force of those rules; and such provision may apply those rules in relation to a bankruptcy notwithstanding that it arose from a petition presented before either the coming into force of the rules or 15th July 1995.
