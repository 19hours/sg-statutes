[21/73]

### Magistrate or police officer may himself enter and search

(c) if he has personal knowledge of such facts and circumstances as satisfy him that there are sufficient grounds for a search under section 11; or

(d) if he receives the required information orally under such circumstances that the object of the search would in his opinion be defeated by the delay necessary for reducing the information to writing to enable a search warrant or written authority to be issued under section 11(1).

### Evidence by police officer to be presumptive evidence

15\. In all proceedings under this Act any evidence given by a police officer that any book, account, document, telegram, writing, circular, card or other article produced before the court had been used or was intended to be used for betting or wagering, shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to be sufficient evidence of the fact.

(3) If on the trial of any offence under this Act the court, after full inquiry into the case, believes that the informer wilfully made in his information a material statement which he knew or believed to be false or did not believe to be true, the court may require the production of the original information and permit inquiry and require full disclosure concerning the informer.

### Obstruction of police officers

17\. Any person who obstructs any police officer in the exercise of any powers under this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.

[8/86]

18\.—(1) Whenever two or more persons are charged with any offence under this Act, the Magistrate’s Court or District Court may require one or more of them to give evidence as a witness or witnesses for the prosecution.

(2) Any such person who refuses to be sworn or affirmed or to answer any lawful question, shall be dealt with in the same way as witnesses so refusing may by law be dealt with by a Magistrate’s Court or District Court.

(3) Every person so required to give evidence who, in the opinion of the court, makes true and full discovery of all things as to which he is lawfully examined, shall be entitled to receive a certificate of indemnity under the hand of the Magistrate or Judge, as the case may be, stating that he has made a true and full discovery of all things as to which he was examined, and such certificate shall be a bar to all legal proceedings against him in respect of such things as aforesaid.

### Binding over on second conviction

19\.—(1) If a person, who has been convicted of an offence under this Act, is again convicted of the same or any other offence under this Act, the Magistrate’s Court or District Court may, in addition to the punishment provided for such offence, make an order requiring him to give security, by bond with one or more sureties, that he will not offend against this Act for such period not exceeding one year, as the court thinks fit to fix.

(2) Every such order shall be made as nearly as may be in the same manner, and shall have the like effect and consequences as if the order were made under section 74 of the Criminal Procedure Code [Cap. 68].

### Jurisdiction of courts

20\. A District Court or a Magistrate’s Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all proceedings under this Act and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Criminal Procedure Code, shall have power to impose the full penalty or punishment in respect of any offence under this Act.

[8/86]

### Stakes

21\. Nothing in this Act shall extend to any person receiving or holding any money or valuable thing by way of stakes or deposit to be paid to the winner of any race or lawful sport, game or exercise or to the owner of any horse engaged in a race.

### Exemption

22\.—(1) The Minister may, by notification in theGazette, either generally or in any particular case and subject to such conditions as he may impose, exempt from all or any of the provisions of this Act —
