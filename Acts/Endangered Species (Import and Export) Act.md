## THE SCHEDULE

Section 2(1)

Scheduled Species

Interpretation of the Appendices

1\. Appendix I includes all species threatened with extinction which are or may be affected by trade. Trade in specimens of these species shall be subject to particularly strict regulation in order not to endanger further their survival and shall only be authorised in exceptional circumstances.

2. Appendix II includes —

(a) all species which may become threatened with extinction unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival; and

(b) other species which are subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species referred to in sub-paragraph (a) may be brought under effective control.

3\. Appendix III includes all species which any contracting State or Party to CITES (also referred to in this Schedule as the Convention) identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purpose of preventing or restricting exploitation, and as needing the cooperation of other Parties in the control of trade.

4. Species included in these Appendices are referred to —

(a) by the name of the species; or

(b) as being all of the species included in a higher taxon or designated part thereof.

5\. The abbreviation “spp.” is used to denote all species of a higher taxon.

6\. Other references to taxa higher than species are for the purposes of information or classification only. The common names included after the scientific names of families are for reference only. They are intended to indicate the species within the family concerned that are included in the Appendices. In most cases this is not all of the species within the family.

7. The following abbreviations are used for plant taxa below the level of species:

(a) “ssp.” is used to denote subspecies; and

(b) “var(s).” is used to denote variety (varieties).

8\. As none of the species or higher taxa of FLORA included in Appendix I is annotated to the effect that its hybrids shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Article III of the Convention, this means that artificially propagated hybrids produced from one or more of these species or taxa may be traded with a certificate of artificial propagation, and that seeds and pollen (including pollinia), cut flowers, seedling or tissue cultures obtained in vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers of these hybrids are not subject to the provisions of the Convention.

9\. The names of the countries in parentheses placed against the names of species in Appendix III are those of the Parties submitting these species for inclusion in this Appendix.

10. When a species is included in one of the Appendices, all parts and derivatives of the species are also included in the same Appendix unless the species is annotated to indicate that only specific parts and derivatives are included. The symbol # followed by a number placed against the name of a species or higher taxon included in Appendix II or III refers to a footnote that indicates the parts or derivatives of plants that are designated as “specimens” subject to the provisions of the Convention in accordance with Article I, paragraph (b), sub-paragraph (iii).

Populations of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe (listed in Appendix II)

:

For the exclusive purpose of allowing:

a) trade in hunting trophies for non-commercial purposes;

c) trade in hides;

d) trade in hair;

e) trade in leather goods for commercial or non-commercial purposes for Botswana, Namibia and South Africa and for non-commercial purposes for Zimbabwe;

f) trade in individually marked and certified ekipas incorporated in finished jewellery for non-commercial purposes for Namibia and ivory carvings for non-commercial purposes for Zimbabwe;

g) trade in registered raw ivory (for Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, whole tusks and pieces) subject to the following:

i) only registered government-owned stocks, originating in the State (excluding seized ivory and ivory of unknown origin);

ii) only to trading partners that have been verified by the Secretariat, in consultation with the Standing Committee, to have sufficient national legislation and domestic trade controls to ensure that the imported ivory will not be re-exported and will be managed in accordance with all requirements of Resolution Conf. 10.10 (Rev. CoP14) concerning domestic manufacturing and trade;

iii) not before the Secretariat has verified the prospective importing countries and the registered government-owned stocks;

iv) raw ivory pursuant to the conditional sale of registered government-owned ivory stocks agreed at CoP12, which are 20,000 kg (Botswana), 10,000 kg (Namibia) and 30,000 kg (South Africa);

v) in addition to the quantities agreed at CoP12, government-owned ivory from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe registered by 31 January 2007 and verified by the Secretariat may be traded and despatched, with the ivory in paragraph g) iv) above, in a single sale per destination under strict supervision of the Secretariat;

vi) the proceeds of the trade are used exclusively for elephant conservation and community conservation and development programmes within or adjacent to the elephant range; and

vii) the additional quantities specified in paragraph g) v) above shall be traded only after the Standing Committee has agreed that the above conditions have been met; and

h) no further proposals to allow trade in elephant ivory from populations already in Appendix II shall be submitted to the Conference of the Parties for the period from CoP14 and ending nine years from the date of the single sale of ivory that is to take place in accordance with provisions in paragraphs g) i), g) ii), g) iii), g) vi) and g) vii). In addition such further proposals shall be dealt with in accordance with Decisions 14.77 and 14.78.

On a proposal from the Secretariat, the Standing Committee can decide to cause this trade to cease partially or completely in the event of non-compliance by exporting or importing countries, or in the case of proven detrimental impacts of the trade on other elephant populations.

All other specimens shall be deemed to be specimens of species included in Appendix I and the trade in them shall be regulated accordingly.
