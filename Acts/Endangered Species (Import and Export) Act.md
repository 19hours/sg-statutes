## THE SCHEDULE

Section 2(1)

Scheduled Species

Interpretation of the Appendices

1. Species included in these Appendices are referred to —

(a) by the name of the species; or

(b) as being all of the species included in a higher taxon or designated part thereof.

2\. The abbreviation “spp.” is used to denote all species of a higher taxon.

3\. Other references to taxa higher than species are for the purposes of information or classification only. The common names included after the scientific names of families are for reference only. They are intended to indicate the species within the family concerned that are included in the Appendices. In most cases this is not all of the species within the family.

4. The following abbreviations are used for plant taxa below the level of species:

(a) “ssp.” is used to denote subspecies; and

(b) “var(s).” is used to denote variety (varieties).

5\. As none of the species or higher taxa of FLORA included in Appendix I is annotated to the effect that its hybrids shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Article III of CITES, this means that artificially propagated hybrids produced from one or more of these species or taxa may be traded with a certificate of artificial propagation, and that seeds and pollen (including pollinia), cut flowers, seedling or tissue cultures obtainedin vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers of these hybrids are not subject to the provisions of CITES.

6\. The names of the countries in parentheses placed against the names of species in Appendix III are those of the parties to CITES submitting these species for inclusion in this Appendix.

7. In accordance with Article I, paragraph (b), sub-paragraph (iii), of CITES, the symbol (#) followed by a number placed against the name of a species or higher taxon included in Appendix II or III designates parts or derivatives which are specified in relation thereto for the purposes of CITES as follows:

1 Designates all parts and derivatives, except:

(a) seeds, spores and pollen (including pollinia);

(b) seedling or tissue cultures obtainedin vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers; and

(c) cut flowers of artificially propagated plants;

2 Designates all parts and derivatives, except:

(a) seeds and pollen;

(b) seedling or tissue cultures obtainedin vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers;

(c) cut flowers of artificially propagated plants; and

(d) chemical derivatives and finished pharmaceutical products;

3 Designates whole and sliced roots and parts of roots, excluding manufactured parts or derivatives such as powders, pills, extracts, tonics, teas and confectionery;

4 Designates all parts and derivatives, except:

(a) seeds, except those from Mexican cacti originating in Mexico, and pollen;

(b) seedling or tissue cultures obtainedin vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers;

(c) cut flowers of artificially propagated plants;

(d) fruits and parts and derivatives thereof of naturalised or artificially propagated plants; and

(e) separate stem joints (pads) and parts and derivatives thereof of naturalised or artificially propagated plants of the genusOpuntiasubgenusOpuntia;

5 Designates logs, sawn wood and veneer sheets;

6 Designates logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood;

7 Designates logs, wood-chips and unprocessed broken material;

8 Designates all parts and derivatives, except:

(a) seeds and pollen (including pollinia);

(b) seedling or tissue cultures obtainedin vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers;

(c) cut flowers of artificially propagated plants; and

(d) fruits and parts and derivatives thereof of artificially propagated plants of the genusVanilla;

9 Designates all parts and derivatives except those bearing a label “Produced fromHoodiaspp. material obtained through controlled harvesting and production in collaboration with the CITES Management Authorities of Botswana/Namibia/South Africa under agreement no. BW/NA/ZA xxxxxx”; and

10 Designates all parts and derivatives except:

i) only registered government-owned stocks, originating in the State (excluding seized ivory and ivory of unknown origin) and, in the case of South Africa, only ivory originating from the Kruger National Park);

ii) only to trading partners that have been verified by the Secretariat, in consultation with the Standing Committee, to have sufficient national legislation and domestic trade controls to ensure that the imported ivory will not be re-exported and will be managed in accordance with all requirements of Resolution Conf. 10.10 (Rev. CoP12) concerning domestic manufacturing and trade;

iii) not before the Secretariat has verified the prospective importing countries, and the MIKE programme has reported to the Secretariat on the baseline information (e.g. elephant population numbers, incidence of illegal killing);

iv) a maximum of 20,000 kg (Botswana), 10,000 kg (Namibia) and 30,000 kg (South Africa) of ivory may be traded, and despatched in a single shipment under strict supervision of the Secretariat;

v) the proceeds of the trade are used exclusively for elephant conservation and community conservation and development programmes within or adjacent to the elephant range; and

vi) only after the Standing Committee has agreed that the above conditions have been met.

On a proposal from the Secretariat, the Standing Committee can decide to cause this trade to cease partially or completely in the event of non-compliance by exporting or importing countries, or in the case of proven detrimental impacts of the trade on other elephant populations.

8Artificially propagated specimens of hybrids of the generaCymbidium,Dendrobium,PhalaenopsisandVandaare not subject to the provisions of the Convention when:

1) the specimens are traded in shipments consisting of individual containers (i.e. cartons, boxes or crates) each containing 20 or more plants of the same hybrid;

2) the plants within each container can be readily recognized as artificially propagated specimens by exhibiting a high degree of uniformity and healthiness; and

3) the shipments are accompanied by documentation, such as an invoice, which clearly states the number of plants of each hybrid.

Artificially propagated specimens of the following hybrids:

– Cymbidium: Interspecific hybrids within the genus and intergeneric hybrids

– Dendrobium: Interspecific hybrids within the genus known in horticulture as “nobile-types” and “phalaenopsis-types”

– Phalaenopsis: Interspecific hybrids within the genus and intergeneric hybrids

– Vanda: Interspecific hybrids within the genus and intergeneric hybrids are not subject to the provisions of the Convention when:

1) they are traded in flowering state, i.e. with at least one open flower per specimen, with reflexed petals;

2) they are professionally processed for commercial retail sale, e.g. labelled with printed labels and packaged with printed packages;

3) they can be readily recognized as artificially propagated specimens by exhibiting a high degree of cleanliness, undamaged inflorescences, intact root systems and a general absence of damage or injury that could be attributable to plants originating in the wild;

4) the plants do not exhibit characteristics of wild origin, such as damage by insects or other animals, fungi or algae adhering to leaves, or mechanical damage to inflorescences, roots, leaves or other parts resulting from collection; and

5) the labels or packages indicate the trade name of the specimen, the country of artificial propagation or, in the case of international trade during the production process, the country where the specimen was labelled and packaged; and the labels or packages show a photograph of the flower, or demonstrate by other means the appropriate use of labels and packages in an easily verifiable way.

Plants not clearly qualifying for the exemption must be accompanied by appropriate CITES documents.
