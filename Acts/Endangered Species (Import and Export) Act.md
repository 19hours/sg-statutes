## THE SCHEDULE

Section 2(1)

Scheduled Species

Interpretation of the Appendices

1\. Appendix I includes all species threatened with extinction which are or may be affected by trade. Trade in specimens of these species shall be subject to particularly strict regulation in order not to endanger further their survival and shall only be authorised in exceptional circumstances.

2. Appendix II includes —

(a) all species which may become threatened with extinction unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival; and

(b) other species which are subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species referred to in sub-paragraph (a) may be brought under effective control.

3\. Appendix III includes all species which any contracting State or Party to CITES (also referred to in this Schedule as the Convention) identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purpose of preventing or restricting exploitation, and as needing the cooperation of other Parties in the control of trade.

4. Species included in these Appendices are referred to —

(a) by the name of the species; or

(b) as being all of the species included in a higher taxon or designated part thereof.

5\. The abbreviation “spp.” is used to denote all species of a higher taxon.

6\. Other references to taxa higher than species are for the purposes of information or classification only. The common names included after the scientific names of families are for reference only. They are intended to indicate the species within the family concerned that are included in the Appendices. In most cases this is not all of the species within the family.

7. The following abbreviations are used for plant taxa below the level of species:

(a) “ssp.” is used to denote subspecies; and

(b) “var(s).” is used to denote variety (varieties).

8\. As none of the species or higher taxa of FLORA included in Appendix I is annotated to the effect that its hybrids shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Article III of the Convention, this means that artificially propagated hybrids produced from one or more of these species or taxa may be traded with a certificate of artificial propagation, and that seeds and pollen (including pollinia), cut flowers, seedling or tissue cultures obtainedin vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers of these hybrids are not subject to the provisions of the Convention.

9\. The names of the countries in parentheses placed against the names of species in Appendix III are those of the Parties submitting these species for inclusion in this Appendix.

10. When a species is included in one of the Appendices, all parts and derivatives of the species are also included in the same Appendix unless the species is annotated to indicate that only specific parts and derivatives are included. The symbol # followed by a number placed against the name of a species or higher taxon included in Appendix II or III refers to a footnote that indicates the parts or derivatives of plants that are designated as “specimens” subject to the provisions of the Convention in accordance with Article I, paragraph (b), sub-paragraph (iii).

only to trading partners that have been verified by the Secretariat, in consultation with the Standing Committee, to have sufficient national legislation and domestic trade controls to ensure that the imported ivory will not be re-exported and will be managed in accordance with all requirements of Resolution Conf. 10.10 (Rev. CoP16) concerning domestic manufacturing and trade;

(iii)

not before the Secretariat has verified the prospective importing countries and the registered government-owned stocks;
