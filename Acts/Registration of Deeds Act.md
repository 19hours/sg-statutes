(b) a description of the estate or interest in the land given to or claimed by the caveator and, if the caveator is the purchaser or sub-purchaser of the estate or interest claimed in the caveat, the amount of the purchase price and the date of the caveator’s contract or the date on which he exercised the option to purchase the interest in the land, as the case may be.

[Act 27 of 1993 wef 01/03/1994]

(3) Where a part of a Government survey lot is affected, the caveat shall have a plan annexed edging with sufficient identity that part of the lot affected.

(4) The Registrar shall not register a caveat which does not —

(a) disclose any estate or interest in land; or

(5) Where, after the acceptance of any caveat for provisional registration, the Registrar discovers that the caveat does not comply with any of the requirements under this section or the rules, the Registrar may cancel the provisional registration.

(6) Notwithstanding subsections (4) and (5), the Registrar shall not be concerned to consider whether or not a caveator’s claim is justified.

(7) Where a caveat is lodged by a person claiming an estate or interest in land or by his solicitor or agent, such a person shall serve a notice by registered post on the proprietor of the land and all persons who have prior claims as shown in the register, and the Registrar shall not be concerned to inquire whether or not such a notice has been effected.

(c) unless the boundaries of all lands affected thereby have been surveyed and demarcated to the satisfaction of the Chief Surveyor or unless there is annexed to the original instrument presented for registration an assurance plan which is referred to in section 21 of the Land Surveyors Act [Cap. 156] and has been endorsed by the Chief Surveyor to indicate that it has been approved by him with the caution as to the inconclusiveness of its boundaries and dimensions;

(3) If by error any instrument has a wrong town subdivision or mukim number, demarcation lot number or part number, or a wrong area endorsed upon it, the Collector of Land Revenue may visit the land and there hold an inquiry into the matter, and if the Collector is satisfied that all the parties to the instrument who can be found within Singapore or their representatives, if any, admit the error and that the instrument has in fact been wrongly endorsed, then, notwithstanding the absence of any parties who are dead or have left Singapore, the Collector may, by order in writing, direct the endorsement on the instrument to be corrected and may himself make the correction upon the instrument being produced to him.

(4) A certified copy of any order made under subsection (3) shall be served by the Collector on the Registrar who shall make it available for inspection by the public.

(5) Upon the service of a certified copy of any order made under subsection (3) on the Registrar, any instrument, register, book or index kept at the Registry which is affected by the order shall be construed as if the corrections directed by the Collector had been in the instrument, register, book or index and the Registrar shall, if it is practicable for him to do so, make the corrections on the instrument, register, book or index.

### Priority of instruments

14\.—(1) Subject to this Act, all instruments registered under any repealed enactment, or entitled to be registered under this Act, shall have priority according to the date of their registration and not according to the date of the instruments or of their execution.

(2) Nothing in this Act shall interfere with the priorities as between themselves of any instruments the dates of registration of which are identical.

(3) All priorities given by this Act shall have full effect in all courts except in cases of actual fraud, to which the person by or on whose behalf the registration is made is a party, and all persons claiming thereunder any legal or equitable interests are entitled to corresponding priorities, and no such person shall lose any such priority merely in consequence of his having been affected with actual or constructive notice except in cases of actual fraud to which he is a party.

(4) Nothing in this section shall operate to confer upon any person claiming without valuable consideration under any person any further priority or protection than would belong to the person under whom he claims, and any disposition of land or charge on land which, if unregistered, would be fraudulent and void shall, notwithstanding registration, be fraudulent and void in like manner.

15\.—(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a prior mortgagee of land shall have the right to make further advances giving further credit or accommodation to rank in priority to subsequent mortgages —

(a) if the prior mortgage authorises the making of further advances, or the giving of credit in instalments or on a current, revolving or continuing account or other accommodation; or

(b) where the prior mortgage does not expressly authorise the making of such further advances, or for the giving of credit in instalments or on a current, revolving or continuing account or other accommodation, if the subsequent mortgagee agrees to such further advances being made or such credit or other accommodation being given.

[Act 27/1993 wef 01/03/1994]

(2) Except as provided in this section, the right to tack shall not apply to mortgages.

### Rights of purchasers to relief to be same as those of persons through whom they claim

16\. Any person claiming under any assurance duly registered shall have and be entitled to all the same grounds of relief as against any person claiming through any assurance of a subsequent date to that under which he claims but which has acquired priority by earlier registration as the person through whom he claims under that first-mentioned assurance might have had and been entitled to.

### Registration

17\.—(1) Subject to this Act and the rules, the Registrar shall register all assurances and other instruments that are entitled to be registered under this Act which or memorials of which are presented to him for registration in the order in which they are so presented and shall make such entries as are prescribed.
