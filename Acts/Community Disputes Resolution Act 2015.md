(2) Any court (at first instance or on appeal) may make a direction that a contravening party comply with a disobeyed order within a specified time if the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the contravening party has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the disobeyed order.

(3) Where a court in subsection (2) makes a special direction, the court may also order any person as the court may specify, to enter into a bond to ensure that the contravening party complies with that direction.

(4) The court may, in making an order under subsection (3) for a person to enter into a bond, impose such conditions on or give such directions to that person, as part of the bond, as the court thinks fit, for the purpose of ensuring that the contravening party complies with the special direction.

(b) in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $1,000 for every day or part of the day during which the offence continues after conviction, but not exceeding $10,000 in total.

(2) It shall not be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) that the court which made an order under section 5 or the court which made a special direction should not have, for whatever reason, made that order or direction.

(3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) for failure to comply with a special direction, the failure to comply with the special direction as well as the failure to comply with the order of court made under section 5 which is the subject of that special direction is not punishable as a contempt of court.

(3) A second court may make an exclusion order on such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit.

(4) In deciding whether it is just and equitable for an exclusion order to be made, the court is to consider all the following matters:

(i) the contravening party;

(ii) any individual who, at the time of the making of the order, resides in the same place of residence as the contravening party; and

(2) A tenancy may be terminated by giving written notice which must specify a date of re‑possession that is at least 14 days after the date on which the notice is given.

(3) A landlord is entitled to terminate a tenancy in accordance with this section despite anything in any other law or in any agreement, and section 18 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap. 61) does not apply to or in relation to any tenancy which is lawfully terminated under this section.

(4) A landlord is not liable in respect of any termination of a tenancy in accordance with this section.

(5) Where a landlord terminates a tenancy for a specified residence in accordance with this section and there is a sub‑tenancy derived out of that tenancy in relation to that specified residence —

If a court orders X to enter into a bond under section 6(3), X is entitled to terminate the tenancy which X has entered into with Y but may not terminate the tenancy which X has entered into with Z.
