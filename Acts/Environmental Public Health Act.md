### Search warrant against premises used as common betting-house

11\.—(1) A Magistrate or a police officer not below the rank of assistant superintendent on being satisfied, upon written information, and after any further inquiry which he thinks necessary, that there is good reason to believe that any place is kept or used as a common betting-house may by warrant under his hand or by writing under his hand, as the case may be, authorise any person therein named, or any police officer, with such assistance, and by such force, as is necessary, by night or by day, to enter or go to that place and to search the place and all persons found therein, and to seize all books, documents, telegrams, writings, circulars, cards or other articles reasonably supposed to have been used or intended to be used as a subject or means of betting or wagering, or in connection therewith, and all moneys and securities for money which are found in that place or on any such persons, and also to detain all such persons until they and that place have been searched.

### Search warrant against persons in possession of betting instruments

12\. A Magistrate or a police officer not below the rank of assistant superintendent on being satisfied upon reasonable information and after any inquiry which he may think necessary, that there is good reason to believe that any books, documents, telegrams, writings, circulars, cards or other articles used as a subject or means of betting or wagering, or in connection therewith, are likely to be found on any person may by warrant under his hand or by writing under his hand, as the case may be, order any police officer to arrest and search that person and if any such article is found upon his person he shall be taken before a Magistrate’s Court or District Court to be dealt with according to law.

[21/73]

### Magistrate or police officer may himself enter and search

14\. A Magistrate or a police officer not below the rank of assistant superintendent may himself do what he may under sections 11 and 12 authorise a police officer to do whenever the Magistrate or police officer not below the rank of assistant superintendent is competent to issue a warrant or written authority under those sections respectively and also in any of the following cases:

(a) if any person has, within the preceding 6 months, been convicted of having kept or used as a common betting-house the place proposed to be entered;

(b) if the place proposed to be entered is occupied by a club or society which has not been exempted under section 22 and he has reason to believe that betting or wagering on horse-races, fights, games or sports is frequently carried on there;

(c) if he has personal knowledge of such facts and circumstances as satisfy him that there are sufficient grounds for a search under section 11; or

(d) if he receives the required information orally under such circumstances that the object of the search would in his opinion be defeated by the delay necessary for reducing the information to writing to enable a search warrant or written authority to be issued under section 11(1).

### Evidence by police officer to be presumptive evidence

15\. In all proceedings under this Act any evidence given by a police officer that any book, account, document, telegram, writing, circular, card or other article produced before the court had been used or was intended to be used for betting or wagering, shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to be sufficient evidence of the fact.

[21/73]
