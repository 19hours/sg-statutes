193\.—(1) Where the amount at credit in a fidelity fund is insufficient to pay the whole amount of all claims against it which have been allowed or in respect of which orders of the High Court have been made, then the amount at credit in the fund shall, subject to subsection (2), be apportioned between the claimants in such manner as the securities exchange or futures exchange thinks equitable, and such claim shall, so far as it then remains unpaid, be charged against future receipts of the fund and paid out of the fund when moneys are available therein.
