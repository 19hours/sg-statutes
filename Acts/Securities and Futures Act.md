the court may, on the application of the Authority or any claimant, make an order against any other person (referred to in this section as a third party) who has received the whole or any part of the benefit of that contravention for disgorgement of that benefit, being benefit derived from trades carried out for the third party by the person referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

(2) The court shall issue a notice to a third party against whom an application for an order for disgorgement under subsection (1) is made, giving the third party an opportunity to show cause, within such time as may be specified in the notice, why the order should not be made.

(b) the third party has so altered his position in reliance on his having an indefeasible interest in the benefit that, in the opinion of the court, it would be inequitable to make the order for disgorgement or to order disgorgement of the entire benefit derived by him, as the case may be.

(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4), the court may make an order for disgorgement against a third party referred to in subsection (4) of a sum that is, in the opinion of the court, equitable.

(7) The court may, after the expiry of the date fixed under subsection (6), order that each claimant who has filed and proven his claim for compensation be paid out of the sum under the final order for disgorgement, an amount —

(a) equal to the amount of loss suffered by the claimant, after deducting any other compensation paid or payable to the same claimant under an order of court or an agreement to pay in respect of the same contravention; or

(b) equal to the pro-rated portion of the sum under the final order for disgorgement, calculated according to the relationship which the amount referred to in paragraph (a) bears to all amounts proved to the court,

whichever is the lesser.

(8) Any sum remaining under the order for disgorgement shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.

(9) If the third party fails to pay the sums under the order for disgorgement within the time specified in the court order under subsection (7) ––

(a) each claimant may recover the sum due to him under the order for disgorgement as though it were a judgment debt due to him; and

(b) the remaining sum under the order for disgorgement may be recovered by the Authority as though it were a judgment debt due to the Authority and paid into the Consolidated Fund.

(10) After the expiry of the date fixed under subsection (6), no person shall make any subsequent application under this section for an order for disgorgement against the third party in respect of the same contravention.

(11) For the purposes of this section, an order for disgorgement is made final if —

(a) the order is not set aside on appeal or revision or is varied only as to the sum to be disgorged;

(b) the order is not subject to further appeal;

(c) no notice of appeal against the order is lodged within the time prescribed by Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5); or

(d) any appeal against the order is withdrawn.

“claimant”, in relation to a contravention of any provision in this Part, means any person who would qualify as a claimant under section 234 in respect of that contravention.
