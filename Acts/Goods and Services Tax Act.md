### Credit for input tax against output tax

19\.—(1) A taxable person shall, in respect of supplies made by him, account for and pay tax by reference to such accounting periods as the Minister may by regulations prescribe (referred to in this Act as a prescribed accounting period) at such time and in such manner as may be determined by the regulations and such regulations may make different provisions for different circumstances.

(2) Subject to this section, a taxable person is entitled at the end of each such period to credit for so much of his input tax as is allowable under section 20, and then to deduct that amount from any output tax that is due from him.

(3) Subject to subsection (4) —

(a) “input tax”, in relation to a taxable person, means the following:

(ii) tax on the reverse charge supply treated as made by him (as a recipient) to himself under section 14(2);

(iii) tax paid or payable by him on the importation of any goods,

(b) services that are the subject of a reverse charge supply of a taxable person; or

(c) goods imported by a taxable person,

are used or to be used partly for the purposes of a business carried on or to be carried on by him and partly for other purposes, tax on supplies and importations must be apportioned so that only so much as is referable to his business purposes is counted as his input tax.

[Act 52 of 2018 wef 01/01/2019]

(5) Subject to subsections (5A), (6) and (7), if either no output tax is due at the end of the period, or the amount of the credit exceeds that of the tax, then, the amount of the credit or, as the case may be, the amount of the excess shall be paid to the taxable person by the Comptroller.

[20/2010 wef 01/10/2010]

(5A) In an accounting period —

(a) where the tax accounted for by the taxable person pursuant to regulations made under section 27A is equal to or exceeds the amount of credit or excess referred to in subsection (5), the amount of the credit or excess shall be nil; and

(b) where the tax accounted for is less than the amount of credit or excess, the amount of the credit or excess shall be the amount of the credit or excess less the amount of that tax.

[20/2010 wef 01/10/2010]

(6) The whole or any part of the credit may, subject to and in accordance with regulations, be held over to be credited in and for a subsequent period; and the regulations may allow for it to be so held over either on the taxable person’s own application or in accordance with general or special directions given by the Comptroller from time to time.

(7) Where at the end of any period an amount is due under subsection (5) to a taxable person who has failed to submit returns, to comply with any reasonable request by the Comptroller for information or to pay tax or penalty for any period as required by this Act, the Comptroller may —

(a) withhold payment of that amount until that person has submitted the returns, complied with the request or paid the tax or penalty, as the case may be; and

(b) deduct from the amount due any tax or penalty which the taxable person is liable to pay and which remains unpaid.

(8) No deduction shall be made under subsection (2) nor shall any payment be made under subsection (5), except on a claim made in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed by regulations.

(9) In the case of a person who has made no taxable supplies in the period concerned or any previous period, payment under subsection (5) shall be made subject to such conditions (if any) imposed by the Comptroller as he thinks fit, including conditions as to repayment in specified circumstances.

(10) Subject to subsections (8) and (9), any payment due under subsection (5) shall be paid within such time as may be prescribed by regulations.

(11) If the Comptroller fails to make payment within the prescribed time, interest on such amount as is outstanding shall, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, be paid to the taxable person at such rate as may be prescribed and calculated in accordance with the regulations.

(12) Except as the Comptroller otherwise allows, where —

(a) a taxable person fails to pay his supplier the consideration or any part thereof for the supply of any goods or services made by his supplier to him; and

(b) the taxable person has credited under subsection (2) the input tax to which the consideration or the part thereof which he failed to pay relates,

the taxable person shall account of an amount equal to such input tax —

(i) in the prescribed accounting period during which the initial specified period expires; and

(ii) in accordance with the method which he was required to use when he first credited the input tax,

and the taxable person shall repay such amount to the Comptroller at the same time as any tax in respect of the prescribed accounting period would be payable by him.

[38/2005 wef 01/01/2006]

(12A) Where a taxable person —

(a) has complied with subsection (12); and

(b) during the subsequent specified period, pays his supplier the whole or part of the consideration for the supply of goods or services referred to in subsection (12)(a),

the taxable person shall be entitled to treat an amount equal to the input tax relating to the payment referred to in paragraph (b) as if it were input tax for the prescribed accounting period during which the payment was made.

[38/2005 wef 01/01/2006]

(13) The Minister may by regulations provide —

(a) for tax on the supply of goods or services to a taxable person, or paid or payable by him on the importation of goods, to be treated as his input tax only if and to the extent that the charge to tax is evidenced and quantified by reference to such documents as may be specified in the regulations or as the Comptroller may direct either generally or in particular cases or classes of cases;

(b) for a taxable person to count as his input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply to him of goods or services or paid by him on the importation of goods notwithstanding that he was not a taxable person at the time of the supply or payment;

(c) for a taxable person that is a body corporate to count as its input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply or importation of goods acquired for it before its incorporation or on the supply of services before that time for its benefit or in connection with its incorporation;

(d) in the case of a person who has been, but is no longer, a taxable person, for him to be paid by the Comptroller the amount of any tax on a supply of services made to him for the purposes of the business carried on by him when he was a taxable person.

(14) The Minister may by regulations provide, in relation to such supplies and importations as the regulations may specify, that tax charged on them or any part thereof is to be excluded from any credit under this section; and —

(a) any such provision may be framed by reference to the description of goods or services supplied or goods imported, the person by whom they are supplied or imported or to whom they are supplied, the purposes for which they are supplied or imported, or any circumstances whatsoever; and

(b) such regulations may contain provision for consequential relief from output tax.

[UK VAT Act 1983, s. 14]

(14A) For the purposes of this section, where a supply of any goods or intellectual property rights is made by way of a sale, lease or licence of any interest in or right over the goods or intellectual property rights to a bare trustee (with such interest or right to be held as a bare trustee), the supply to the bare trustee is to be treated as a supply made to the persons or person for whose business the bare trustee holds the interest or right.

[Act 31 of 2014 wef 01/01/2015]

(15) In this section —

“initial specified period” means a period of 12 months from the due date for payment of the consideration or the part thereof, as the case may be, by the taxable person to his supplier;

(2) The supplies within this subsection are the following supplies made or to be made by the taxable person in the course or furtherance of his business:

(a) taxable supplies;

(aa) supplies permitted to be made under section 27 or regulations made under section 27 without payment of the tax chargeable on the supplies;

(a) where the tax attributable to exempt supplies would be less than such amount, or less than such part of the whole of the input tax, as may be prescribed;

(b) where such supplies are made to a taxable person for the purpose of any business carried on by him; or

(c) in other prescribed circumstances.

(4) The Minister may make regulations for securing a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to supplies within subsection (2), and any such regulations may provide for —

(a) determining a proportion by reference to which input tax for any prescribed accounting period is to be provisionally attributed to those supplies;

(c) the making of payments in respect of input tax, by the Comptroller to a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) or by a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) to the Comptroller, in cases where events prove inaccurate an estimate on the basis of which an attribution was made.

(5) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4), regulations made under that subsection may —

(a) make different provisions for different circumstances and, in particular, for different descriptions of goods or services; and

(b) contain such incidental and supplementary provisions as appear to the Minister necessary or expedient.

### Customers to account for tax on relevant supplies of goods or services

38A\.—(1) This section applies in circumstances where a taxable person (called in this section the supplier) makes a relevant supply of goods or services to a person (called in this section the customer) who is registered under this Act at the time when the relevant supply is made.

(2) Where the relevant supply of goods or services is made by the supplier in connection with the carrying on by the customer of any business, then, it is for the customer to account for and pay tax on the relevant supply as if the customer were the supplier; and the supplier must not require payment from the customer, of the tax on the relevant supply or an amount as being attributable to the tax.

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) prevents section 78(2) from applying to the supplier if, despite that subsection, the supplier issues an invoice for the relevant supply of goods or services showing it as taking place with tax chargeable on it.

(4) So much of this Act and of any written law as has effect for the purposes of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any obligation to account for and pay goods and services tax apply for the purposes of this section in relation to the customer, as if the tax were tax on a supply made by the customer.

(5) If the relevant supply of goods or services is not made by the supplier to the customer in connection with the carrying on by the customer of any business, the customer must notify the supplier of that fact; and if the customer fails to do so, the customer must, unless otherwise allowed by the Comptroller —

(a) pay to the Comptroller without demand the amount of tax chargeable on the relevant supply to which the failure relates; and

(b) include the amount of tax mentioned in paragraph (a) as output tax in the customer’s return.

(ii) any other matter whether or not related to a description or characteristic of the goods or services;

(b) to provide for the application (with such modification as may be prescribed) of this section to a case where —

(i) the value of a relevant supply of goods or services is increased by an amount (I) after the supply is made; or

(ii) the value of a supply of goods or services is increased by an amount (I) after the supply is made, such that it becomes a relevant supply of goods or services,

including by treating a separate supply of goods or services as having taken place with a value equal toI;

(c) to require, in a case where —

(i) the value of a relevant supply of goods or services is adjusted after the supply is made; or

(ii) the value of a supply of goods or services is increased after the supply is made, such that it becomes a relevant supply of goods or services,

the supplier or customer, or both, to make corresponding adjustments to the tax accounted for or paid, or to be accounted for or paid, in the form and manner required by the Comptroller;

(d) generally for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section.

(7) The regulations made under subsection (6) may make different provisions for different circumstances (including the circumstances under which paragraph (c) of the definition of “relevant supply of goods or services” in subsection (10) does not apply).

(8) This section does not apply to any supply of goods or services prescribed as a prescribed supply under section 38.

(9) To avoid doubt, relevant supplies of goods or services are not taxable supplies of the customer for the purposes of the First Schedule.

(10) In this section —

“excepted supply” means any supply of goods or services that is prescribed as an excepted supply;

“relevant supply of goods or services” means any taxable supply of goods or services that is prescribed for the purpose of this definition, but not if —

(b) an amount has been paid to any person as being due to him in accordance with section 19(5), which ought not to have been paid to him,

the Comptroller may assess that amount as being tax due from him for the prescribed accounting period in which the amount was repaid or, as the case may be, paid and accordingly notify him of the assessment.

(3) Where a person is assessed under subsections (1) and (2) in respect of the same prescribed accounting period, the assessments may be combined and notified to him as one assessment.

(4) Where the person failing to make a return, or making a return which appears to the Comptroller to be incomplete or incorrect, was required to make the return as a personal representative, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidator or person otherwise acting in a representative capacity in relation to another person, subsection (1) shall apply as if the reference to tax due from him included a reference to a tax due from that other person.

(c) as a result of a failure to make a return for a later prescribed accounting period, being a failure by the person referred to in paragraph (a) or a person acting in a representative capacity in relation to him, as mentioned in subsection (4), the Comptroller finds it necessary to make another assessment under subsection (1),

then, if the Comptroller thinks fit, having regard to the failure referred to in paragraph (a), he may specify in the assessment referred to in paragraph (c) an amount of tax greater than that which he would otherwise have considered to be appropriate.

(a) under the same provision as that assessment was made; and

make a supplementary assessment of the amount of the excess and shall notify the person accordingly.

(9) Where an amount has been assessed and notified to any person under subsection (1), (2), (6A) or (8), it shall, subject to the provisions of this Act as to review and appeals, be deemed to be an amount of tax due from him and may be recovered accordingly, unless, or except to the extent that, the assessment has subsequently been withdrawn or reduced.

[Act 52 of 2018 wef 01/01/2019]

(c) that, if all the taxable supplies of or the services mentioned in section 14(1)(a) received for (as the case may be) that business were taken into account, a person carrying on that business would, at the time of the direction, be liable to be registered by virtue of paragraph 1, 1A or 1B; and

[Act 52 of 2018 wef 01/01/2019]

(3) A direction made under this paragraph shall be served on each of the persons named in it.

(a) the date with effect from which the single taxable person concerned became liable to be registered; and

(b) the date of the direction.

[Act 52 of 2018 wef 01/01/2019]

(6) In relation to a business specified in a direction under this paragraph, the persons named in the direction, together with any person named in a supplementary direction relating to that business (being the persons who together are to be treated as the taxable person), are in sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) referred to as “the constituent members”.

(7) Where a direction is made under this paragraph, then, for the purposes of this Act —

(a) the taxable person carrying on the business specified in the direction shall be registrable in such name as the persons named in the direction may jointly nominate by notice in writing given to the Comptroller not later than 14 days after the date of the direction or, in default of such a nomination, in such name as may be specified in the direction;

(b) any supply of goods or services by or to one of the constituent members in the course of the activities of the taxable person shall be treated as a supply by or to that person;

(c) each of the constituent members shall be jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the taxable person;

(d) without prejudice to sub-paragraph (c), any failure by the taxable person to comply with any requirement imposed by or under this Act shall be treated as a failure by each of the constituent members severally; and

(e) subject to sub-paragraphs (a) to (d), the constituent members shall be treated as a partnership carrying on the business of the taxable person and any question as to the scope of the activities of that business at any time shall be determined accordingly.

(8) If it appears to the Comptroller that any person who is one of the constituent members should no longer be regarded as such for the purposes of sub-paragraph (7)(c) and (d) and the Comptroller gives notice to that effect, that person shall not have any liability by virtue of those sub-paragraphs for anything done after the date specified in that notice and, accordingly, on that date he shall be treated as having ceased to be a member of the partnership referred to in sub-paragraph (7)(e).
