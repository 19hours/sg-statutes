(2) If, within 14 days after the time applicable under section 11(2) or (3), the person making the supply issues a tax invoice in respect of it, then, unless he has notified the Comptroller in writing that he elects not to avail himself of this subsection, the supply shall (to the extent that it is not treated as taking place at the time mentioned in subsection (1)) be treated as taking place at the time the invoice is issued.

(3) The Comptroller may, at the request of a taxable person, direct that subsection (2) shall apply in relation to supplies made by him (or such supplies made by him as may be specified in the direction) as if for the period of 14 days there were substituted such longer period as may be specified in the direction.

(4) Where a taxable person provides a document to himself which —

(a) purports to be a tax invoice in respect of a supply of goods or services to him by another taxable person; and

(b) is in accordance with regulations made under section 41 and the Comptroller has approved that it be treated as the tax invoice required by the regulations to be provided by the supplier,

subsections (2) and (3) shall have effect in relation to that supply as if —

(i) the provision of the document to himself by the first- mentioned taxable person were the issue by the supplier of a tax invoice in respect of the supply; and

(ii) any notice of election given or request made by the first- mentioned taxable person for the purposes of those provisions had been given or made by the supplier.

(5) The Comptroller may, at the request of a taxable person, by direction in writing alter the time at which supplies made by him (or such supplies made by him as may be specified in the direction) are to be treated as taking place, either —

(a) by directing those supplies to be treated as taking place —

(i) at times or on dates determined by or by reference to the occurrence of some event described in the direction; or

(8) The Minister may by regulations make provision with respect to the time at which (notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3), (6) and (7) and sections 11 and 38(4)) a supply is to be treated as taking place in cases where —

(a) it is a supply of goods or services for a consideration the whole or part of which is determined or payable periodically, or from time to time, or at the end of any period;

### Place of supply

13\.—(1) This section shall apply for determining, for the purposes of the charge to tax, whether goods or services are supplied in Singapore.

(2) If the supply of any goods does not involve their removal from or to Singapore, they shall be treated as supplied in Singapore if they are in Singapore and otherwise shall be treated as supplied outside Singapore.

(4) A supply of services shall be treated as made —

(a) in Singapore if the supplier belongs in Singapore; and

(b) in another country (and not in Singapore), if the supplier belongs in that other country.

(5) The Minister may by regulations provide, in relation to services generally or to particular services specified in the regulations, for varying the rules for determining where a supply of services is made.

14\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), where any supply of prescribed services, not being services within any of the descriptions specified in the Fourth Schedule, are —

(a) supplied by a person who belongs in a country other than Singapore; and

(b) received by a person (referred to in this section as the recipient) who belongs in Singapore for the purposes of any business carried on by him,

then all the same consequences shall follow under this Act (and particularly so much as charges tax on a supply and entitles a taxable person to credit for input tax) as if the recipient had himself supplied the services in Singapore in the course or furtherance of his business, and that supply were a taxable supply.

(2) Supplies which are treated as made by the recipient under subsection (1) are not to be taken into account as supplies made by him when determining the allowance of input tax in his case under section 20(1).

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1) —

(2) Subject to this section, a taxable person is entitled at the end of each such period to credit for so much of his input tax as is allowable under section 20, and then to deduct that amount from any output tax that is due from him.

(3) Subject to subsection (4) —

(a) “input tax”, in relation to a taxable person, means the following tax:

(i) tax on the supply to him of any goods or services; and

(3A) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), tax payable by a taxable person on the importation of goods shall not include any tax that is accountable pursuant to regulations made under section 27A until such time as the tax has in fact been accounted for in accordance with those regulations.

(4) Where goods or services supplied to a taxable person, or goods imported by him, are used or to be used partly for the purposes of a business carried on or to be carried on by him and partly for other purposes, tax on supplies and importations shall be apportioned so that only so much as is referable to his business purposes is counted as his input tax.

(5) Subject to subsections (5A), (6) and (7), if either no output tax is due at the end of the period, or the amount of the credit exceeds that of the tax, then, the amount of the credit or, as the case may be, the amount of the excess shall be paid to the taxable person by the Comptroller.

[20/2010 wef 01/10/2010]

(5A) In an accounting period —

(a) where the tax accounted for by the taxable person pursuant to regulations made under section 27A is equal to or exceeds the amount of credit or excess referred to in subsection (5), the amount of the credit or excess shall be nil; and

(b) where the tax accounted for is less than the amount of credit or excess, the amount of the credit or excess shall be the amount of the credit or excess less the amount of that tax.

[20/2010 wef 01/10/2010]

(6) The whole or any part of the credit may, subject to and in accordance with regulations, be held over to be credited in and for a subsequent period; and the regulations may allow for it to be so held over either on the taxable person’s own application or in accordance with general or special directions given by the Comptroller from time to time.

(7) Where at the end of any period an amount is due under subsection (5) to a taxable person who has failed to submit returns, to comply with any reasonable request by the Comptroller for information or to pay tax or penalty for any period as required by this Act, the Comptroller may —

(a) withhold payment of that amount until that person has submitted the returns, complied with the request or paid the tax or penalty, as the case may be; and

(b) deduct from the amount due any tax or penalty which the taxable person is liable to pay and which remains unpaid.

(8) No deduction shall be made under subsection (2) nor shall any payment be made under subsection (5), except on a claim made in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed by regulations.

(9) In the case of a person who has made no taxable supplies in the period concerned or any previous period, payment under subsection (5) shall be made subject to such conditions (if any) imposed by the Comptroller as he thinks fit, including conditions as to repayment in specified circumstances.

(10) Subject to subsections (8) and (9), any payment due under subsection (5) shall be paid within such time as may be prescribed by regulations.

(11) If the Comptroller fails to make payment within the prescribed time, interest on such amount as is outstanding shall, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, be paid to the taxable person at such rate as may be prescribed and calculated in accordance with the regulations.

(a) a taxable person fails to pay his supplier the consideration or any part thereof for the supply of any goods or services made by his supplier to him; and

(b) the taxable person has credited under subsection (2) the input tax to which the consideration or the part thereof which he failed to pay relates,

the taxable person shall account of an amount equal to such input tax —

(i) in the prescribed accounting period during which the initial specified period expires; and

(ii) in accordance with the method which he was required to use when he first credited the input tax,

and the taxable person shall repay such amount to the Comptroller at the same time as any tax in respect of the prescribed accounting period would be payable by him.

(12A) Where a taxable person —

(a) has complied with subsection (12); and

(b) during the subsequent specified period, pays his supplier the whole or part of the consideration for the supply of goods or services referred to in subsection (12)(a),

the taxable person shall be entitled to treat an amount equal to the input tax relating to the payment referred to in paragraph (b) as if it were input tax for the prescribed accounting period during which the payment was made.

(13) The Minister may by regulations provide —

(a) for tax on the supply of goods or services to a taxable person, or paid or payable by him on the importation of goods, to be treated as his input tax only if and to the extent that the charge to tax is evidenced and quantified by reference to such documents as may be specified in the regulations or as the Comptroller may direct either generally or in particular cases or classes of cases;

(b) for a taxable person to count as his input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply to him of goods or services or paid by him on the importation of goods notwithstanding that he was not a taxable person at the time of the supply or payment;

(c) for a taxable person that is a body corporate to count as its input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply or importation of goods acquired for it before its incorporation or on the supply of services before that time for its benefit or in connection with its incorporation;

(d) in the case of a person who has been, but is no longer, a taxable person, for him to be paid by the Comptroller the amount of any tax on a supply of services made to him for the purposes of the business carried on by him when he was a taxable person.

(14) The Minister may by regulations provide, in relation to such supplies and importations as the regulations may specify, that tax charged on them or any part thereof is to be excluded from any credit under this section; and —

(a) any such provision may be framed by reference to the description of goods or services supplied or goods imported, the person by whom they are supplied or imported or to whom they are supplied, the purposes for which they are supplied or imported, or any circumstances whatsoever; and

(b) such regulations may contain provision for consequential relief from output tax.

(15) In this section —

“initial specified period” means a period of 12 months from the due date for payment of the consideration or the part thereof, as the case may be, by the taxable person to his supplier;

“subsequent specified period” means —

(a) where the prescribed accounting period during which the relevant input tax was first credited under subsection (2) ends before 1st January 2007, a period —

20\.—(1) The amount of input tax for which a taxable person is entitled to credit at the end of any prescribed accounting period shall be so much of the input tax for the period (that is input tax on supplies and importations in the period) as is allowable by or under regulations as being attributable to supplies within subsection (2).

(2) The supplies within this subsection are the following supplies made or to be made by the taxable person in the course or furtherance of his business:

(a) where the tax attributable to exempt supplies would be less than such amount, or less than such part of the whole of the input tax, as may be prescribed;

(b) where such supplies are made to a taxable person for the purpose of any business carried on by him; or

(c) in other prescribed circumstances.

(4) The Minister may make regulations for securing a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to supplies within subsection (2), and any such regulations may provide for —

(a) determining a proportion by reference to which input tax for any prescribed accounting period is to be provisionally attributed to those supplies;

(b) adjusting, in accordance with a proportion determined in like manner for any longer period comprising 2 or more prescribed accounting periods or parts thereof, the provisional attribution for any of those periods; and

(c) the making of payments in respect of input tax, by the Comptroller to a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) or by a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) to the Comptroller, in cases where events prove inaccurate an estimate on the basis of which an attribution was made.

(5) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4), regulations made under that subsection may —

(a) make different provisions for different circumstances and, in particular, for different descriptions of goods or services; and

(b) contain such incidental and supplementary provisions as appear to the Minister necessary or expedient.

45\.—(1) Where a person has failed to make any returns required under this Act or to keep any documents and afford the facilities necessary to verify such returns or where it appears to the Comptroller that such returns are incomplete or incorrect, the Comptroller may to the best of his judgment assess the amount of tax due from that person and notify him of it.

(2) In any case where —

(a) an amount has been repaid to any person as being a repayment of tax, which ought not to have been repaid; or

(b) an amount has been paid to any person as being due to him in accordance with section 19(5), which ought not to have been paid to him,

the Comptroller may assess that amount as being tax due from him for the prescribed accounting period in which the amount was repaid or, as the case may be, paid and accordingly notify him of the assessment.

(3) Where a person is assessed under subsections (1) and (2) in respect of the same prescribed accounting period, the assessments may be combined and notified to him as one assessment.

(4) Where the person failing to make a return, or making a return which appears to the Comptroller to be incomplete or incorrect, was required to make the return as a personal representative, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidator or person otherwise acting in a representative capacity in relation to another person, subsection (1) shall apply as if the reference to tax due from him included a reference to a tax due from that other person.

(5) An assessment under subsection (1) or (2) of an amount of tax due for any prescribed accounting period shall not be made —

(a) in the case of a prescribed accounting period ending before 1st January 2007, more than 7 years from the end of the prescribed accounting period; and

(b) in the case of a prescribed accounting period ending on or after 1st January 2007, more than 5 years from the end of the prescribed accounting period.

(6) Where a taxable person has acquired or imported any goods in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by him, the Comptroller may require him from time to time to account for the goods.

(6A) If the taxable person fails to prove that —

(a) the goods have been or are available to be supplied by him or have been exported from Singapore otherwise than by way of supply; or

(b) the goods have been lost or destroyed,

the Comptroller may assess to the best of his judgment and notify the taxable person of the amount of tax that would have been chargeable in respect of the supply of the goods if they had been supplied by him.

(7) In any case where —

(a) as a result of a person’s failure to make a return for a prescribed accounting period, the Comptroller has made an assessment under subsection (1) for that period;

(b) the tax assessed has been paid but no proper return has been made for the period to which the assessment related; and

(c) as a result of a failure to make a return for a later prescribed accounting period, being a failure by the person referred to in paragraph (a) or a person acting in a representative capacity in relation to him, as mentioned in subsection (4), the Comptroller finds it necessary to make another assessment under subsection (1),

then, if the Comptroller thinks fit, having regard to the failure referred to in paragraph (a), he may specify in the assessment referred to in paragraph (c) an amount of tax greater than that which he would otherwise have considered to be appropriate.

(8) Where it appears to the Comptroller that the amount which ought to have been assessed in an assessment under this section exceeds the amount which was so assessed, the Comptroller may —

(a) under the same provision as that assessment was made; and

(b) within the period during which that assessment could have been made,

make a supplementary assessment of the amount of the excess and shall notify the person accordingly.

(9) Where an amount has been assessed and notified to any person under subsection (1), (2), (6A) or (8), it shall, subject to the provisions of this Act as to review and appeals, be deemed to be an amount of tax due from him and may be recovered accordingly, unless, or except to the extent that, the assessment has subsequently been withdrawn or reduced.

(10) The Comptroller may at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment made under this section as he thinks necessary to ensure the correctness thereof and notify the person accordingly.

(10A) Where the Comptroller raises an assessment under subsection (1) upon the failure of a person to make any returns, and, subsequent to such assessment, the person makes a return, the Comptroller may, in his discretion, take into account the return and revise his assessment as he deems fit.

(10B) For the purpose of subsection (10A), where a person makes a return in respect of a prescribed accounting period ending on or after 1st January 2007 more than 5 years from the end of the prescribed accounting period, the return shall be treated as not having been made.

(11) For the purposes of this section, notification to a personal representative, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidator or person otherwise acting as aforesaid shall be treated as notification to the person in relation to whom he so acts.

[25/96]

(a) has been convicted of an offence under section 62 where the assessment or recovery of penal tax was made pursuant to an order made by the court on such conviction; or

(b) has not been convicted of any offence under this Act but no proceedings shall be taken in respect of any offence against a person who has paid the penal tax assessed against him for that same offence.

Registration

Liability to be registered

1.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) to (5), a person who makes taxable supplies but is not registered is liable to be registered —

(a) at the end of any quarter where the total value of all his taxable supplies made in Singapore in that quarter and the 3 quarters immediately preceding that quarter has exceeded $1 million; or

(b) at any time, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of his taxable supplies in the period of 12 months then beginning will exceed $1 million.

(2) Where a business carried on by a taxable person is transferred to another person as a going concern and the transferee is not registered at the time of the transfer, then, subject to sub-paragraphs (3) to (5), the transferee becomes liable to be registered at that time if —

(a) the total value of all his taxable supplies made in Singapore in the quarter of the time of the transfer and the 3 quarters immediately preceding that quarter has exceeded $1 million; or

(b) there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of his taxable supplies in the period of 12 months then beginning will exceed $1 million.

(3) A person is not liable to be registered by virtue of sub-paragraph (1)(a) or (2) (a) after the end of any quarter if the Comptroller is satisfied that the value of his taxable supplies in the next 4 quarters will not exceed $1 million.

(4) In determining the value of a person’s supplies for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a) or (2) (a), supplies made at a time when he was previously registered shall be disregarded if —

(a) his registration was cancelled otherwise than under paragraph 14; and

(b) the Comptroller is satisfied that before his registration was cancelled he had given the Comptroller all the information the Comptroller needed in order to determine whether to cancel the registration.

(5) In determining the value of a person’s supplies for the purpose of sub-paragraph (1) or (2), supplies of goods or services that are capital assets of the business in the course or furtherance of which they are supplied shall be disregarded.

2.—(1) Without prejudice to section 47 and to paragraph 1, if the Comptroller makes a direction under this paragraph, the persons named in the direction shall be treated as a single taxable person carrying on the activities of a business described in the direction and that taxable person shall be liable to be registered with effect from the date of the direction or, if the direction so provides, from such later date as may be specified therein.

(2) The Comptroller may make a direction under this paragraph naming any person where the Comptroller is satisfied —

(a) that he is making or has made taxable supplies;

(b) that the activities in the course of which he makes or made those taxable supplies form only part of certain activities which should properly be regarded as those of the business described in the direction, the other activities being carried on concurrently or previously (or both) by one or more other persons;

(c) that, if all the taxable supplies of that business were taken into account, a person carrying on that business would, at the time of the direction, be liable to be registered by virtue of paragraph 1; and

(d) that the main reason or one of the main reasons for the person concerned carrying on the activities first referred to in sub-paragraph (b) in the way he does is the avoidance of a liability to be registered (whether that liability would be his, another person’s or that of 2 or more persons jointly).

(3) A direction made under this paragraph shall be served on each of the persons named in it.

(4) Where, after a direction has been given under this paragraph specifying a description of business, it appears to the Comptroller that a person who has not been named in that direction is making taxable supplies in the course of activities which should properly be regarded as part of the activities of that business, the Comptroller may make and serve on him a supplementary direction referring to the earlier direction and the description of business specified in it and adding that person’s name to those of the persons named in the earlier direction with effect from —

(a) the date on which he began to make those taxable supplies; or

(b) if it was later, the date on which the single taxable person referred to in the earlier direction became liable to be registered.

(5) If, immediately before a direction (including a supplementary direction) is made under this paragraph, any person named in the direction is registered in respect of the taxable supplies made by him as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) or (4), he shall cease to be liable to be so registered with effect from whichever is the later of —

(a) the date with effect from which the single taxable person concerned became liable to be registered; and

(b) the date of the direction.

(6) In relation to a business specified in a direction under this paragraph, the persons named in the direction, together with any person named in a supplementary direction relating to that business (being the persons who together are to be treated as the taxable person), are in sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) referred to as “the constituent members”.

(7) Where a direction is made under this paragraph, then, for the purposes of this Act —

(a) the taxable person carrying on the business specified in the direction shall be registrable in such name as the persons named in the direction may jointly nominate by notice in writing given to the Comptroller not later than 14 days after the date of the direction or, in default of such a nomination, in such name as may be specified in the direction;

(b) any supply of goods or services by or to one of the constituent members in the course of the activities of the taxable person shall be treated as a supply by or to that person;

(c) each of the constituent members shall be jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the taxable person;

(d) without prejudice to sub-paragraph (c), any failure by the taxable person to comply with any requirement imposed by or under this Act shall be treated as a failure by each of the constituent members severally; and

(e) subject to sub-paragraphs (a) to (d), the constituent members shall be treated as a partnership carrying on the business of the taxable person and any question as to the scope of the activities of that business at any time shall be determined accordingly.

(8) If it appears to the Comptroller that any person who is one of the constituent members should no longer be regarded as such for the purposes of sub-paragraph (7)(c) and (d) and the Comptroller gives notice to that effect, that person shall not have any liability by virtue of those sub-paragraphs for anything done after the date specified in that notice and, accordingly, on that date he shall be treated as having ceased to be a member of the partnership referred to in sub-paragraph (7)(e).

End of liability to be registered

3.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), a registered person who makes taxable supplies shall cease to be liable to be registered at any time if the Comptroller is satisfied that the value of his taxable supplies in the period of 12 months then beginning will not exceed $1 million.

(2) A person shall not cease to be liable to be registered by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) if the Comptroller is satisfied that the reason the value of his taxable supplies will not exceed $1 million is that in the period in question he will cease making taxable supplies, or will suspend making them for a period of 30 days or more.

6.—(1) A person who becomes liable to be registered by virtue of paragraph 1(2) shall notify the Comptroller of the liability within 30 days of the time when the business is transferred.

(2) The Comptroller shall register any such person (whether or not that person so notifies the Comptroller) with effect from the time when the business is transferred.
