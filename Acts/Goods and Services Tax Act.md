(b) received by a person (referred to in this section as the recipient) who belongs in Singapore for the purposes of any business carried on by him,

then all the same consequences shall follow under this Act (and particularly so much as charges tax on a supply and entitles a taxable person to credit for input tax) as if the recipient had himself supplied the services in Singapore in the course or furtherance of his business, and that supply were a taxable supply.

(2) Supplies which are treated as made by the recipient under subsection (1) are not to be taken into account as supplies made by him when determining the allowance of input tax in his case under section 20(1).

(b) he has no such establishment in any country but his usual place of residence is in that country; or

(c) he has such establishments both in that country and elsewhere and the establishment of his which is most directly concerned with the supply is in that country.

(3) If the supply of services is made to an individual and received by him otherwise than for the purposes of any business carried on by him, he shall be treated as belonging in whatever country he has his usual place of residence.

(4) Where subsection (3) does not apply, the person to whom the supply is made shall be treated as belonging in a country if —

(a) either of the conditions mentioned in subsection (2)(a) or (b) is satisfied; or

(b) he has such establishments as are mentioned in subsection (2) both in that country and elsewhere and the establishment of his at which, or for the purposes of which, the services are most directly used or to be used is in that country.

(2) If the supply is for a consideration in money, its value shall be taken to be such amount as, with the addition of the tax chargeable, is equal to the consideration.

(3) If the supply is not for a consideration or is for a consideration not consisting or not wholly consisting of money, the value of the supply shall be taken to be its open market value.

(4) Where a supply of any goods or services is not the only matter to which a consideration in money relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it.

(5) For the purposes of this Act, the open market value of a supply of goods or services shall be taken to be the amount that would fall to be taken as its value under subsection (2) if the supply were for such consideration in money as would be payable by a person who has no relationship with any person which would affect that consideration.

## PART IV

CREDIT FOR INPUT TAX AGAINST OUTPUT TAX

### Credit for input tax against output tax

19\.—(1) A taxable person shall, in respect of supplies made by him, account for and pay tax by reference to such accounting periods as the Minister may by regulations prescribe (referred to in this Act as a prescribed accounting period) at such time and in such manner as may be determined by the regulations and such regulations may make different provisions for different circumstances.

(2) Subject to this section, a taxable person is entitled at the end of each such period to credit for so much of his input tax as is allowable under section 20, and then to deduct that amount from any output tax that is due from him.

(3) Subject to subsection (4), “input tax”, in relation to a taxable person, means the following tax, that is to say:

(a) tax on the supply to him of any goods or services; and

(b) tax paid or payable by him on the importation of any goods,

being (in either case) goods or services used or to be used for the purpose of any business carried on or to be carried on by him; and “output tax” means tax on supplies which he makes.

(4) Where goods or services supplied to a taxable person, or goods imported by him, are used or to be used partly for the purposes of a business carried on or to be carried on by him and partly for other purposes, tax on supplies and importations shall be apportioned so that only so much as is referable to his business purposes is counted as his input tax.

(5) Subject to subsections (6) and (7), if either no output tax is due at the end of the period, or the amount of the credit exceeds that of the tax, then, the amount of the credit or, as the case may be, the amount of the excess shall be paid to the taxable person by the Comptroller.

(6) The whole or any part of the credit may, subject to and in accordance with regulations, be held over to be credited in and for a subsequent period; and the regulations may allow for it to be so held over either on the taxable person’s own application or in accordance with general or special directions given by the Comptroller from time to time.

(7) Where at the end of any period an amount is due under subsection (5) to a taxable person who has failed to submit returns, to comply with any reasonable request by the Comptroller for information or to pay tax or penalty for any period as required by this Act, the Comptroller may withhold payment of that amount until that person has submitted the returns, complied with the request or paid the tax or penalty, as the case may be; and the Comptroller may deduct from the amount due any tax or penalty which the taxable person is liable to pay and which remains unpaid.

(8) No deduction shall be made under subsection (2) nor shall any payment be made under subsection (5), except on a claim made in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed by regulations; and, in the case of a person who has made no taxable supplies in the period concerned or any previous period, payment under subsection (5) shall be made subject to such conditions (if any) imposed by the Comptroller as he thinks fit, including conditions as to repayment in specified circumstances.

(9) Subject to subsection (8), any payment due under subsection (5) shall be paid within such time as may be prescribed by regulations and if the Comptroller fails to make payment within the prescribed time, interest on such amount as is outstanding shall, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, be paid to the taxable person at such rate as may be prescribed and calculated in accordance with the regulations.

(10) Where a taxable person fails to pay any amount of input tax on the supply to him of any goods or services in respect of which relief for bad debt or insolvency has been granted to the supplier under any regulations made under section 25(1) and such amount of input tax has been credited under subsection (2) or paid under subsection (5), the amount which he has failed to pay shall be deemed to be output tax on supplies which he makes and he shall accordingly be liable to account for it in the prescribed accounting period in which he knew or could with reasonable diligence have known that the relief had been granted.

(11) The Minister may by regulations provide —

(a) for tax on the supply of goods or services to a taxable person, or paid or payable by him on the importation of goods, to be treated as his input tax only if and to the extent that the charge to tax is evidenced and quantified by reference to such documents as may be specified in the regulations or as the Comptroller may direct either generally or in particular cases or classes of cases;

(b) for a taxable person to count as his input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply to him of goods or services or paid by him on the importation of goods notwithstanding that he was not a taxable person at the time of the supply or payment;

(c) for a taxable person that is a body corporate to count as its input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply or importation of goods acquired for it before its incorporation or on the supply of services before that time for its benefit or in connection with its incorporation;

(d) in the case of a person who has been, but is no longer, a taxable person, for him to be paid by the Comptroller the amount of any tax on a supply of services made to him for the purposes of the business carried on by him when he was a taxable person.

(12) The Minister may by regulations provide, in relation to such supplies and importations as the regulations may specify, that tax charged on them or any part thereof is to be excluded from any credit under this section; and —

(a) any such provision may be framed by reference to the description of goods or services supplied or goods imported, the person by whom they are supplied or imported or to whom they are supplied, the purposes for which they are supplied or imported, or any circumstances whatsoever; and

(b) such regulations may contain provision for consequential relief from output tax.

### Input tax allowable under section 19

20\.—(1) The amount of input tax for which a taxable person is entitled to credit at the end of any prescribed accounting period shall be so much of the input tax for the period (that is input tax on supplies and importations in the period) as is allowable by or under regulations as being attributable to supplies within subsection (2).

(2) The supplies within this subsection are the following supplies made or to be made by the taxable person in the course or furtherance of his business:

(a) taxable supplies;

(b) supplies outside Singapore which would be taxable supplies if made in Singapore;

(c) such other supplies outside Singapore as the Minister may by regulations specify for the purposes of this subsection;

(d) supplies which section 37 or regulations made under section 37A provide are to be disregarded for the purposes of this Act and which would otherwise be taxable supplies.

(3) Regulations may provide for treating some or all supplies of goods or services by any person as taxable supplies —

(a) where the tax attributable to exempt supplies would be less than such amount, or less than such part of the whole of the input tax, as may be prescribed;

(b) where such supplies are made to a taxable person for the purpose of any business carried on by him; or

(c) in other prescribed circumstances.

(4) The Minister may make regulations for securing a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to supplies within subsection (2), and any such regulations may provide for —

(a) determining a proportion by reference to which input tax for any prescribed accounting period is to be provisionally attributed to those supplies;

(b) adjusting, in accordance with a proportion determined in like manner for any longer period comprising 2 or more prescribed accounting periods or parts thereof, the provisional attribution for any of those periods; and

(c) the making of payments in respect of input tax, by the Comptroller to a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) or by a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) to the Comptroller, in cases where events prove inaccurate an estimate on the basis of which an attribution was made.

(5) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4), regulations made under that subsection may make different provisions for different circumstances and, in particular, for different descriptions of goods or services; and may contain such incidental and supplementary provisions as appear to the Minister necessary or expedient.

(2) In any case where —

(a) an amount has been repaid to any person as being a repayment of tax, which ought not to have been repaid; or

(b) an amount has been paid to any person as being due to him in accordance with section 19(5), which ought not to have been paid to him,

the Comptroller may assess that amount as being tax due from him for the prescribed accounting period in which the amount was repaid or, as the case may be, paid and accordingly notify him of the assessment.

(3) Where a person is assessed under subsections (1) and (2) in respect of the same prescribed accounting period, the assessments may be combined and notified to him as one assessment.

(4) Where the person failing to make a return, or making a return which appears to the Comptroller to be incomplete or incorrect, was required to make the return as a personal representative, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidator or person otherwise acting in a representative capacity in relation to another person, subsection (1) shall apply as if the reference to tax due from him included a reference to a tax due from that other person.

(5) An assessment under subsection (1) or (2) of an amount of tax due for any prescribed accounting period shall not be made more than 7 years after the end of the prescribed accounting period; except where, in the opinion of the Comptroller, any form of fraud or wilful default has been committed by or on behalf of any person in connection with or in relation to tax, the Comptroller may for the purpose of making good any loss of tax or payment or refund of tax attributable to fraud or wilful default, make an assessment at any time.

(7) In any case where —

(a) as a result of a person’s failure to make a return for a prescribed accounting period, the Comptroller has made an assessment under subsection (1) for that period;

(b) the tax assessed has been paid but no proper return has been made for the period to which the assessment related; and

(c) as a result of a failure to make a return for a later prescribed accounting period, being a failure by the person referred to in paragraph (a) or a person acting in a representative capacity in relation to him, as mentioned in subsection (4), the Comptroller finds it necessary to make another assessment under subsection (1),

then, if the Comptroller thinks fit, having regard to the failure referred to in paragraph (a), he may specify in the assessment referred to in paragraph (c) an amount of tax greater than that which he would otherwise have considered to be appropriate.

(8) Where it appears to the Comptroller that the amount which ought to have been assessed in an assessment under this section exceeds the amount which was so assessed, the Comptroller may —

(a) under the same provision as that assessment was made; and

(b) within the period during which that assessment could have been made,

make a supplementary assessment of the amount of the excess and shall notify the person accordingly.

(9) Where an amount has been assessed and notified to any person under subsection (1), (2), (6) or (8), it shall, subject to the provisions of this Act as to review and appeals, be deemed to be an amount of tax due from him and may be recovered accordingly, unless, or except to the extent that, the assessment has subsequently been withdrawn or reduced.

(b) that the activities in the course of which he makes or made those taxable supplies form only part of certain activities which should properly be regarded as those of the business described in the direction, the other activities being carried on concurrently or previously (or both) by one or more other persons;

(c) that, if all the taxable supplies of that business were taken into account, a person carrying on that business would, at the time of the direction, be liable to be registered by virtue of paragraph 1; and

(d) that the main reason or one of the main reasons for the person concerned carrying on the activities first referred to in sub-paragraph (b) in the way he does is the avoidance of a liability to be registered (whether that liability would be his, another person’s or that of 2 or more persons jointly).

(3) A direction made under this paragraph shall be served on each of the persons named in it.

(4) Where, after a direction has been given under this paragraph specifying a description of business, it appears to the Comptroller that a person who has not been named in that direction is making taxable supplies in the course of activities which should properly be regarded as part of the activities of that business, the Comptroller may make and serve on him a supplementary direction referring to the earlier direction and the description of business specified in it and adding that person’s name to those of the persons named in the earlier direction with effect from —

(a) the date on which he began to make those taxable supplies; or

(b) if it was later, the date with effect from which the single taxable person referred to in the earlier direction became liable to be registered.

(5) If, immediately before a direction (including a supplementary direction) is made under this paragraph, any person named in the direction is registered in respect of the taxable supplies made by him as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) or (4), he shall cease to be liable to be so registered with effect from whichever is the later of —

(a) the date with effect from which the single taxable person concerned became liable to be registered; and

(b) the date of the direction.

(6) In relation to a business specified in a direction under this paragraph, the persons named in the direction, together with any person named in a supplementary direction relating to that business (being the persons who together are to be treated as the taxable person), are in sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) referred to as “the constituent members”.

(7) Where a direction is made under this paragraph then, for the purposes of this Act —

(a) the taxable person carrying on the business specified in the direction shall be registrable in such name as the persons named in the direction may jointly nominate by notice in writing given to the Comptroller not later than 14 days after the date of the direction or, in default of such a nomination, in such name as may be specified in the direction;

(b) any supply of goods or services by or to one of the constituent members in the course of the activities of the taxable person shall be treated as a supply by or to that person;

(c) each of the constituent members shall be jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the taxable person;

(d) without prejudice to sub-paragraph (c), any failure by the taxable person to comply with any requirement imposed by or under this Act shall be treated as a failure by each of the constituent members severally; and

(e) subject to sub-paragraphs (a) to (d), the constituent members shall be treated as a partnership carrying on the business of the taxable person and any question as to the scope of the activities of that business at any time shall be determined accordingly.

(8) If it appears to the Comptroller that any person who is one of the constituent members should no longer be regarded as such for the purposes of sub-paragraph (7)(c) and (d) and the Comptroller gives notice to that effect, that person shall not have any liability by virtue of those sub-paragraphs for anything done after the date specified in that notice and, accordingly, on that date he shall be treated as having ceased to be a member of the partnership referred to in sub-paragraph (7)(e).
