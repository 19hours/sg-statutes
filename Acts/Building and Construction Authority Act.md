(3) Nothing in the terms and conditions to be drawn up by the Authority shall adversely affect the conditions that would have been applicable to persons transferred to the service of the Authority as regards any pension, gratuity or allowance payable under the Pensions Act (Cap. 225).

(4) In every case, where a person has been transferred to the service of the Authority under section 26, the Government shall be liable to pay to the Authority such portion of any pension, gratuity or allowance payable to such person on his retirement as the same shall bear to the proportion which the aggregate amount of his pensionable emoluments during his service with the Government bears to the aggregate amount of his pensionable emoluments during his service under both the Government and the Authority.

(5) Where any person in the service of the Authority, whose case does not fall within the scope of any pension or other schemes established under this section, retires or dies in the service of the Authority or is discharged from such service, the Authority may grant to him or to such other person or persons wholly or partly dependent on him, as the Authority thinks fit, such allowance or gratuity as the Authority may determine.

### No benefits in respect of abolition or reorganisation of office

28\. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Pensions Act (Cap. 225), no person who is transferred to the service of the Authority under section 26 shall be entitled to claim any benefit under that Act on the ground that he has been retired from the service of the Government on account of abolition or reorganisation of office in consequence of the establishment and incorporation of the Authority.

All deeds, bonds, agreements, instruments and arrangements, subsisting immediately before 1st April 1999 to which the Board or the Government is a party and relating to the Building Control Division of the Public Works Department or to any person transferred to the service of the Authority under section 26 shall continue in force on and after that date and shall be enforceable by or against the Authority as if the Authority had been named therein or had been a party thereto instead of the Board or the Government.

### Continuation and completion of disciplinary proceedings

30\.—(1) Where on 1st April 1999 any disciplinary proceedings were pending against any employee of the Board or the Government transferred to the service of the Authority, the proceedings shall be carried on and completed by the Authority; but where on 1st April 1999 any matter was in the course of being heard or investigated or had been heard or investigated by a committee acting under due authority but no order or decision had been rendered thereon, the committee shall complete the hearing or investigation and make such order, ruling or direction as it could have made under the authority vested in it before that date.

(2) Any order, ruling or direction made or given by a committee pursuant to this section shall be treated as an order, a ruling or a direction of the Authority and have the same force or effect as if it had been made or given by the Authority pursuant to the authority vested in the Authority under this Act.

### Misconduct or neglect of duty by employee before transfer

31\. The Authority may reprimand, reduce in rank, retire, dismiss or punish in some other manner a person who had, whilst he was in the employment of the Board or the Government, been guilty of any misconduct or neglect of duty which would have rendered him liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished in some other manner if he had continued to be in the employment of the Board or the Government, as the case may be, and if this Act had not been enacted.
