(3) To avoid doubt, a person does not intend or foresee a result of his acts by reason only of it being a natural and probable consequence of those acts.

(4) To avoid doubt, nothing in this section prevents a court from relying on a person’s foresight that a certain effect was a probable consequence of his act as a basis to draw an inference that the person caused that effect intentionally.

Explanation.—Intention is distinct from motive or desire, and a person may do an act or cause an effect intentionally even if doing so was not his motive or he had no desire to do so.

### “Knowingly”

26D\.—(1) Whoever does an act with awareness that a circumstance exists, will exist, or is virtually certain (barring an unforeseen intervention) to exist, is said to do that act knowingly in respect of that circumstance.

(2) Whoever does an act with awareness that an effect will be caused, or is virtually certain (barring an unforeseen intervention) to be caused, is said to do that act knowingly in respect of that effect.

(3) Where doing an act knowingly is a fault element of an offence, that fault element is also established where that act is done intentionally.

### “Rashly”

26E\.—(1) Whoever does any act knowing that there is a real risk that a particular circumstance exists or will exist is said to do that act rashly in respect of that particular circumstance, if it would have been unreasonable to have taken that risk.

(3) Where doing an act rashly is a fault element of an offence, that fault element is also established where that act is done intentionally or knowingly.

### “Negligently”

(a) the physical elements of the offence included the doing of an act or the causing of an effect concerning a person or thing;

(b) at the time such act or effect was done or caused, the accused person believed or intended that the act or effect would concern a person or thing different from the person or thing mentioned in paragraph (a).

(4) To avoid doubt, nothing in this section affects the requirement to prove all the fault elements of an offence in order for guilt to be established for that offence.

(2) Strict liability is said to apply to a particular physical element of an offence where there is no corresponding fault element for that physical element, regardless of whether or not the offence is one of strict liability.

(3) To avoid doubt, an offence may be a strict liability offence even though it is not so expressly described by any written law; and strict liability may apply to a particular physical element of any offence even though it is not so expressly described in any written law.

(4) It is a defence for any person charged with a strict liability offence to prove that in committing all the acts or omissions that are physical elements of the offence, he exercised reasonable care.

If, in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which causes the defender to reasonably believe that death would be caused to him or to any other person and the defender is so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk.

Illustration

Ais attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him.Acannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob.Acommits no offence if by so firing he harms any of the children.

Right of private defence of body

### Start and continuance of right of private defence of body

101\.—(1) The right of private defence of the body starts as soon as the defender reasonably believes that there is danger to the body (either his own or that of any other person) arising from any act which is an offence against the human body or an attempt or a threat to commit the offence, though the offence may not have been committed.

(2) The right of private defence continues as long as the belief of danger mentioned in subsection (1) continues.

### When right of private defence of body extends to causing death

### Consent given under misconception in sexual offences

377CB\.—(1) Despite section 90(a)(ii), a consent for the purposes of an act which is the physical element of a sexual offence is not a consent given by a person under a misconception of fact only if it is directly related to —

(b) the purpose of the act, namely that it is not for a sexual purpose; or

(c) the identity of the person doing the act,

and the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such misconception.

(b)AdeceivesBinto believing that he can healB’s chronic disease by treatment involving sexual penetration.Bgives her consent under the misconception that the act is treatment for a health purpose and not for a sexual purpose.B’s apparent consent is therefore not a valid consent.

“

Mistake as to age in sexual offences

377D\.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and despite section 79, a reasonable mistake as to the age of a person cannot be a defence to any charge for a sexual offence.

(2) The presence of a reasonable mistaken belief that a minor was of or above 18 years of age is a valid defence to a charge for a sexual offence where the fact that a minor is of or above the age of 16 years but below 18 years is a physical element of the offence.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the defence under that subsection is no longer available if at the time of the offence, the person charged with that offence —

(a) has previously been charged in court for an offence under section 375(1)(b), 375(1A)(b), 376(1) (if the victimBis below 14 years of age), 376(2) (if the victimBis below 14 years of age), 376A, 376AA, 376B, 376C, 376E, 376EA, 376EB, 376EC, 376ED, 376EE, 377BG, 377BH, 377BI, 377BJ, 377BK or 377BL or section 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act or section 140(1)(i) or 145(1) of the Women’s Charter; or

(b) failed to take all reasonable steps to verify that the minor was of or above 18 years of age.

Explanation.—The fact that the minor was observed to be participating in activities which are restricted to persons of or above 18 years of age, such as smoking a cigarette or admission to premises with access restricted to persons of or above 18 years of age (such as a nightclub) is neither sufficient to constitute a reasonable basis for the mistaken belief nor reasonable steps to verify that minor’s age.

Illustrations

### Punishment for attempting to commit offences

512\.—(1) A person who attempts to commit an offence punishable by this Code or by any other written law with death or imprisonment for life, shall, where no express provision is made by this Code or by such other written law for the punishment of such attempt, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

Illustration

(a) shall not be bound to impose such fixed, specified or mandatory minimum sentence; and

(b) may sentence the offender to such sentence or combination of sentences as the court thinks fit but not exceeding the maximum punishment prescribed for that offence.

(4) To avoid doubt, nothing in subsection (3)(b) empowers a court to impose a type of punishment that is not prescribed for an offence mentioned in subsection (2) or otherwise provided by any written law for that offence.

Illustration

Aattempts to commit robbery but did not succeed. IfAhad committed robbery, he would have been subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not less than 2 years and mandatory caning of a minimum of 6 strokes. As the court is not bound to impose the minimum mandatory punishment prescribed for robbery,Amay be sentenced to 6 months imprisonment with no caning for attempted robbery. However, the court may not sentenceAto a fine, as this is not a prescribed punishment for robbery but the court may sentenceAto probation if he is a young offender.
