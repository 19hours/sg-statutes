[25/99 wef 13/09/1999]

### Statements relating to drug trafficking or criminal conduct

6\.—(1) Where —

(a) there is tendered to the court by the prosecution a statement as to any matters relevant to the determination whether benefits have been derived by the defendant from drug trafficking or from criminal conduct, as the case may be or to the assessment of the value of those benefits; and

(b) the defendant accepts to any extent any allegation in the statement,

the court may, for the purposes of that determination and assessment, treat his acceptance as conclusive of the matters to which it relates.

(2) Where —

(a) a statement is tendered under subsection (1)(a); and

(b) the court is satisfied that a copy of that statement has been served on the defendant,

the court may require the defendant to indicate to what extent he accepts each allegation in the statement and, so far as he does not accept any such allegation, to indicate any matters he proposes to rely on.

(3) If the defendant fails in any respect to comply with a requirement under subsection (2), he may be treated for the purposes of this section as accepting every allegation in the statement apart from any allegation in respect of which he has complied with the requirement.

(4) Where —

(a) there is tendered to the court by the defendant a statement as to any matters relevant to determining the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made; and

(b) the prosecution accepts to any extent any allegation in the statement,

the court may, for the purposes of that determination, treat the acceptance by the prosecution as conclusive of the matters to which it relates.

(5) An allegation may be accepted or a matter indicated for the purposes of this section either —

(a) orally before the court; or

(b) in writing.

(6) No acceptance by the defendant under this section that benefits have been derived by him from drug trafficking or from criminal conduct, as the case may be shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings for an offence.

### Amount to be recovered under confiscation order

7\.—(1) Subject to subsection (3), the amount to be recovered from the defendant under the confiscation order shall be the amount the court assesses to be the value of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking or from criminal conduct, as the case may be.

(2) If the court is satisfied as to any matter relevant for determining the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made (whether by an acceptance under section 6 or otherwise), the court may issue a certificate giving its opinion as to the matters concerned and shall do so if satisfied as mentioned in subsection (3).

(3) If the court is satisfied that the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made is less than the amount the court assesses to be the value of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking or from criminal conduct, as the case may be, the amount to be recovered from the defendant under the confiscation order shall be the amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be so realised.

(4) If, on an application made in accordance with subsection (5), the court is satisfied that the amount that might be realised in the case of the person in question is greater than the amount taken into account in making the confiscation order (whether it was greater than was thought when the order was made or has subsequently increased), the court shall issue a certificate to that effect, giving its reasons.

(5) An application under subsection (4) may be made either by the Public Prosecutor or by a receiver appointed under section 12 or 15 in relation to the realisable property of the person in question.

(6) Where a certificate has been issued under subsection (4), the Public Prosecutor may apply to the court for an increase in the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order; and on that application the court may —

(a) substitute for that amount such amount (not exceeding the amount assessed as the value referred to in subsection (1)) as appears to the court to be appropriate having regard to the amount now shown to be realisable; and

(b) increase the term of imprisonment fixed in respect of the confiscation order under section 10(1) if the effect of the substitution is to increase the maximum period applicable in relation to the order under section 10(1).

### Interest on sums unpaid under confiscation order

7A\.—(1) If any sum required to be paid by a person under a confiscation order is not paid when it is required to be paid, that person shall be liable to pay interest on that sum for the period for which it remains unpaid.

(2) The amount of the interest shall for the purposes of enforcement be treated as part of the amount to be recovered from him under the confiscation order.

(3) The rate of interest under subsection (1) shall be at the same rate as a judgment debt.

[25/99 wef 13/09/1999]

### Definition of principal terms used
