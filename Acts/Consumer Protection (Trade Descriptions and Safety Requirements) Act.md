(3) For the purposes of this Act, a trade description published in any newspaper, book or periodical or in any film or sound or television broadcast shall not be deemed to be a trade description applied in the course of a trade or business unless it is or forms part of an advertisement.

### Appointment of Director of Consumer Protection and other officers

## PART II

PROHIBITION OF FALSE TRADE DESCRIPTIONS

### Prohibition of false trade descriptions

4\. Subject to the provisions of this Act, any person who in the course of a trade or business —

(a) applies a false trade description to any goods; or

(b) supplies any goods to which a false trade description is applied,

shall be guilty of an offence.

### False trade descriptions

5\. For the purposes of this Part —

(a) a false trade description means a trade description which by reason of anything contained therein or omitted therefrom is false or likely to mislead in a material respect as regards the goods to which it is applied or in connection with which it is used, and includes every alteration of a trade description whether by way of addition, effacement or otherwise which makes the description false or likely to mislead in a material respect; and

(b) a false indication, or anything likely to be taken as an indication which would be false, that any goods comply with a standard specified or recognised by any person or implied by the approval of any person shall be deemed to be a false trade description, if there is no such person or no standard as specified, recognised or implied.

### Applying trade description to goods

6\.—(1) A person applies a trade description to goods if he —

(a) affixes or annexes it to or in any manner marks it on or incorporates it with —

(i) the goods themselves; or

(ii) anything in, on or with which the goods are supplied;

(b) places the goods in, on or with anything which the trade description has been affixed or annexed to, marked on or incorporated with, or places any such thing with the goods; or

(c) uses the trade description in any manner likely to be taken as referring to the goods.

(2) An oral statement may amount to the use of a trade description.

(3) Where goods are supplied in pursuance of a request in which a trade description is used and the circumstances are such as to make it reasonable to infer that the goods are supplied as goods corresponding to that description, the person supplying the goods shall be deemed to have applied that trade description to the goods.

### Trade descriptions used in advertisements

7\.—(1) This section shall have effect where in an advertisement a trade description is used in relation to any class of goods.

(2) The trade description shall be taken as referring to all goods of the class, whether or not in existence at the time the advertisement is published —

(a) for the purpose of determining whether an offence has been committed under section 4(a); and

(b) where goods of the class are supplied by a person publishing or displaying the advertisement, also for the purpose of determining whether an offence has been committed under section 4(b).

(3) In determining for the purposes of this section whether any goods are of a class to which a trade description used in an advertisement relates, regard shall be had not only to the form and content of the advertisement but also to the time, place, manner and frequency of its publication and all other matters making it likely or unlikely that a person to whom the goods are supplied would think of the goods as belonging to the class in relation to which the trade description is used in the advertisement.

### Trade marks containing trade descriptions

8\. A trade description which is or is part of a trade mark within the meaning of the Trade Marks Act (Cap. 332) may be a false trade description when applied to any goods, except where all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) it could have been lawfully applied to the goods if this Act had not been passed;

(b) on 1st August 1975 the trade mark either is registered under the Trade Marks Act or is in use to indicate a connection in the course of trade between those goods and the proprietor of the trade mark;

(c) the trade mark as applied is used to indicate such a connection between the goods and the proprietor of the trade mark or a registered user of the trade mark under the Trade Marks Act; and

(d) the person who is the proprietor of the trade mark is the same person as, or a successor in title of, the proprietor on 1st August 1975.

[46/98]

## PART III

POWER TO REQUIRE INFORMATIVE MARKING AND TO IMPOSE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### Informative marking, etc., of goods

9\.—(1) Where it appears to the Minister necessary or expedient in the interest of persons to whom any goods are supplied that the goods should be marked with or accompanied by any information (whether or not amounting to or including a trade description) or instruction relating to the goods, the Minister may by regulations impose requirements for securing that the goods are so marked or accompanied, and control or prohibit the supply of goods with respect to which those requirements are not complied with.

(2) Where any regulations made under this section are in force with respect to goods of any description, any person who, in the course of any trade or business, supplies goods of that description in contravention of those regulations shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be guilty of an offence.

### Information, etc., to be given in advertisements

10\.—(1) Where it appears to the Minister necessary or expedient in the interest of persons to whom any goods are to be supplied that any description of advertisements of the goods should contain or refer to any information (whether or not amounting to or including a trade description) relating to the goods, the Minister may by regulations impose requirements as to the inclusion of that information, or of an indication of the means by which it may be obtained, in such description of advertisements of the goods as may be specified in the regulations.

(2) Regulations made under this section may specify the form and manner in which any such information or indication is to be included in advertisements of any description and may make different provision for different circumstances.

(3) Where an advertisement of any goods to be supplied in the course of any trade or business fails to comply with any requirement imposed by regulations made under this section, any person who publishes the advertisement shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be guilty of an offence.

### Safety requirements

11\.—(1) The Minister may, if he considers it necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting the safety of consumers, by regulations impose with respect to any prescribed class or description of goods —

(a) requirements for securing that goods of that class or description should comply with those requirements whether as to composition or contents, design, construction, finish or packing as the Minister thinks fit; and

(b) requirements for securing that goods of that class or description should be marked with or accompanied by any information, warning or instruction,

and control or prohibit the supply of goods with respect to which those requirements are not complied with.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where regulations made under this section are in force with respect to any class or description of goods, any person who, in the course of any trade or business, supplies such goods in contravention of those regulations shall be guilty of an offence.

(3) A contravention of the regulations made under this section by a person referred to in subsection (2) shall be deemed to be a breach of a statutory duty for which action may be brought by any other person who may be affected by the contravention.

### Regulations under sections 9 and 11

12\. Regulations made under sections 9 and 11 may —

(a) specify a class or description of goods notwithstanding that the goods are for use only as component parts of other goods;

(b) make different provisions for different classes or descriptions of goods or for different circumstances;

(c) provide for the form or manner in which information or instruction is to be given; and

(d) contain such exemptions from the operation of those sections as may be provided.

### Application of this Part

13\. The provisions of this Part shall not apply to any goods which are subject to and regulated by the provisions of any of the written laws specified in the Schedule.

## PART IV

OTHER MIS-STATEMENTS

### False representation as to supply or approval of goods

14\.—(1) If any person in the course of any trade or business gives by whatever means any false indication, direct or indirect, that any goods supplied by him or any methods adopted by him are or are of a kind supplied to or approved by any person including any government or government department or agency or any international body or agency whether in Singapore or abroad, he shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be guilty of an offence.

(2) Subsection (1) shall have effect without prejudice to any written law prohibiting or restricting the use of any name, emblem, insignia, seal, flag, pennant, title, coat of arms, sign, words or letters or any other form of description.

## PART V

PROVISIONS AS TO OFFENCES

### Defence of mistake, accident, etc.

19\.—(1) In any proceedings for an offence under this Act, it shall, subject to subsection (2), be a defence for the person charged to prove —

(b) that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by himself or any person under his control.

(2) If in any case the defence provided by subsection (1) involves the allegation that the commission of the offence was due to the act or default of another person or to reliance on information supplied by another person, the person charged shall not, without leave of the court, be entitled to rely on that defence unless, within a period ending 7 clear days before the hearing, he has served on the prosecutor a notice in writing giving such information as was then in his possession identifying or assisting in the identification of that other person.

(3) In any proceedings for an offence under this Act of supplying goods to which a false trade description is applied, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that he did not know, and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained, that the goods did not conform to the description or that the description had been applied to the goods.

### Innocent publication of advertisement

In proceedings for an offence under this Act committed by the publication of an advertisement, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that he is a person whose business it is to publish or arrange for the publication of advertisements and that he received the advertisement for publication in the ordinary course of business and did not know and had no reason to suspect that its publication would amount to an offence under this Act.

(2) The Director or an officer authorised by him shall, on seizing any goods or documents in the exercise of his powers under this section, inform the person from whom they are seized and, in the case of goods seized from a vending machine, the person whose name and address are stated on the machine as being the proprietor or, if no name and address are so stated, the occupier of the premises on which the machine stands or to which it is affixed.

(6) All things forfeited or deemed to be forfeited shall be delivered to the Director and shall be disposed of in accordance with the directions of the Minister.
