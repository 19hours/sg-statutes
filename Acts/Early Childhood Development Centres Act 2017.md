(4) The Chief Licensing Officer may, after considering any written representation under subsection (3)(c), decide to take such regulatory action in subsection (1) or (2) as the Chief Licensing Officer considers appropriate.

(9) A licensee who fails to pay any amount of a financial penalty imposed under subsection (2)(g) within the period specified for payment by the Chief Licensing Officer under that subsection is liable to pay interest at the same rate as for a judgment debt on the unpaid amount.

(10) Despite subsection (8), any financial penalty imposed on a licensee under subsection (2)(g) and any interest payable under subsection (9) is recoverable as a debt due to the Government, and the licensee’s liability to pay is not affected by the licensee’s licence ceasing, for any reason, to be in force.

(11) In any proceedings under this section in relation to the conviction of a licensee or any person for a criminal offence, the Chief Licensing Officer is to accept the licensee’s or person’s conviction as final and conclusive.
