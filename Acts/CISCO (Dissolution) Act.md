(3) If any question arises as to whether any particular property, right or liability of the Corporation has been transferred to or vested in the successor company under this Act, a certificate under the hand of the Minister for Finance shall be conclusive evidence that the property, right or liability was or was not so transferred or vested.

(5) It shall be the duty of the successor company to take all such steps as may be requisite to secure that the vesting in the company by virtue of this section of any foreign property, right or liability is effective under the relevant foreign law and until such time it shall be the duty of the Government to hold that property or right for the benefit of, or to discharge that liability on behalf of, the company.

(6) Nothing in subsection (5) shall be taken as prejudicing the effect under the laws of Singapore of the vesting in the successor company by virtue of this section of any foreign property, right or liability.

(7) Any expenses incurred and liabilities discharged by the successor company under subsection (5) shall be paid by the successor company.

(8) In subsections (5) and (6), references to any foreign property, right or liability are references, respectively, to any property, right or liability comprised in the undertaking of the Corporation in respect of which any issue arising in any proceedings would have been determined (in accordance with the rules of conflict of laws) by reference to the law of a country or territory outside Singapore.

### Successor of Corporation

7\. The successor company shall be taken for all purposes, including the rules of private international law, to be the successor of the Corporation, except in respect of any assets and liabilities comprised in the undertaking of the Corporation transferred to any other body or person.

then, on and after the transfer date, the Children Development Co-Savings Act shall continue to apply to the woman in relation to the confinement in respect of which she would have been entitled to leave as if the Corporation continued to be her employer.

(4) If —

(a) immediately before the transfer date, a woman was an employee of the Corporation and was on maternity leave granted under section 9 of the Children Development Co-Savings Act;

(b) the woman becomes an employee of the successor company under section 8; and

(c) the woman would have been entitled to remain on that leave, after the transfer date, if the Corporation had continued to exist and the woman had continued to be employed by the Corporation,

then, on and after the transfer date, the Children Development Co-Savings Act shall continue to apply to the woman in relation to the confinement in respect of which the leave was granted as if the Corporation continued to be her employer.

(5) For the avoidance of doubt, section 18A of the Employment Act (Cap. 91) shall not apply to the transfer under this Part of any employee of the Corporation to the successor company.

(4) The successor company may, subject to the Police Force Act, reprimand, reduce in rank, retire, dismiss or punish in some other manner a person who had, while he was in the employment of the Corporation, been guilty of any misconduct or neglect of duty which would have rendered him liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished in some other manner if he had continued to be in the employment of the Corporation and if this Act had not been enacted.

(5) In this section, any reference to the Police Force Act includes a reference to the Auxiliary Police Forces Regulations made under that Act.
