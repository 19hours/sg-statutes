### Application of criminal law to certain act or omission on aircraft

3\.—(1) Any act or omission taking place on board a Singapore-controlled aircraft while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore which, if taking place in Singapore, would constitute an offence under the law in force in Singapore, shall constitute that offence.

(1A) If —

(a) any act or omission taking place on board any aircraft (not being a Singapore‑controlled aircraft) while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore which, if taking place in Singapore, would constitute an offence under the law in force in Singapore; and

(b) the aircraft subsequently lands in Singapore with the person who committed the act or omission still on board the aircraft,

the act or omission constitutes that offence.

[Act 32 of 2018 wef 15/09/2018]

(1B) Subsections (1) and (1A) do not apply to any act or omission which is expressly or impliedly authorised by or under the law in force in Singapore when taking place outside Singapore.

[Act 32 of 2018 wef 15/09/2018]

(2) No proceedings for any offence under the law in force in Singapore committed on board an aircraft while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore other than an offence under the Air Navigation Act [Cap. 6] or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder shall be instituted in Singapore except by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.

[15/2010 wef 02/01/2011]

(3) Subsection (2) shall not prevent the arrest, or the issue of a warrant for the arrest, of any person in respect of any offence, or the remanding in custody or on bail of any person charged with any offence.

(4) For the purpose of conferring jurisdiction, any offence under the law in force in Singapore committed on board an aircraft in flight shall be deemed to be committed in Singapore.

[Act 32 of 2018 wef 15/09/2018]

### Provisions as to extradition

4\.—(1) For the purposes of the application of the Extradition Act (Cap. 103) to crimes committed on board an aircraft in flight, any offence committed on board any aircraft in flight is to be treated as if it had been committed not only in the place at which the offence occurred, but also within the territory of —

(a) a Convention country in which the aircraft is registered;

(b) a Convention country (being also a Protocol country) in which the lessee of the aircraft leased without crew has its principal place of business or, if the lessee has no such place of business, has its permanent residence; or

(c) a Convention country (being also a Protocol country) in which the aircraft lands, with the offender still on board.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), it does not matter whether the aircraft mentioned in that subsection is for the time being also within the jurisdiction of any other country.

[Act 32 of 2018 wef 15/09/2018]

### Powers of commander of aircraft

5\.—(1) Subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) shall have effect for the purposes of any proceeding before any court in Singapore.

(2) If the commander of an aircraft in flight, wherever that aircraft may be, has reasonable grounds to believe in respect of any person on board the aircraft —

(a) that the person in question has done or is about to do any act on the aircraft while it is in flight which jeopardises or may jeopardise —

(i) the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property on board the aircraft; or

(ii) good order and discipline on board the aircraft; or

(b) that the person in question has done on the aircraft while in flight any act which in the opinion of the commander is a serious offence under any law in force in the country in which the aircraft is registered, not being a law of a political nature or based on racial or religious discrimination,

then, subject to subsection (4), the commander may take with respect to that person such reasonable measures, including restraint of his person, as may be necessary —

(i) to protect the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property on board the aircraft;

(ii) to maintain good order and discipline on board the aircraft; or

(iii) to enable the commander to disembark or deliver that person in accordance with subsection (5),

and for the purposes of paragraph (b) any Singapore-controlled aircraft shall be deemed to be registered in Singapore whether or not it is in fact so registered and whether or not it is in fact registered in some other country.

(3) Any member of the crew of an aircraft and any other person on board the aircraft may, at the request or with the authority of the commander of the aircraft, and any such member shall if so required by that commander, render assistance in restraining any person whom the commander is entitled under subsection (2) to restrain; and at any time when the aircraft is in flight any such member or other person may, without obtaining the authority of the commander, take with respect to any person on board the aircraft any measures such as are mentioned in subsection (2) which he has reasonable grounds to believe are immediately necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property on board the aircraft.

(4) Any restraint imposed on any person on board an aircraft under the powers conferred by this section shall not be continued after the time when the aircraft first thereafter ceases to be in flight unless before or as soon as is reasonably practicable after that time the commander of the aircraft causes notification of the fact that a person on board the aircraft is under restraint and of the reasons therefor to be sent to an appropriate authority of the country in which the aircraft so ceases to be in flight, but subject to such notification may be continued after that time —

(a) for any period (including the period of any further flight) between that time and the first occasion thereafter on which the commander is able with any requisite consent of the appropriate authorities to disembark or deliver the person under restraint in accordance with subsection (5); or

(b) if the person under restraint agrees to continue his journey under restraint on board that aircraft.

(5) The commander of an aircraft —

(a) if in the case of any person on board the aircraft he has reasonable grounds —

(i) to believe as mentioned in subsection (2)(a); and

(ii) to believe that it is necessary to do so in order to protect the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property on board the aircraft or to maintain good order and discipline on board the aircraft,

may disembark that person in any country in which that aircraft may be; and

(b) if in the case of any person on board the aircraft he has reasonable grounds to believe as mentioned in subsection (2)(b), may deliver that person —

(i) in Singapore, to a police officer or immigration officer; or

(ii) in any other country which is a Convention country, to an officer having functions corresponding to the functions either of a police officer or of an immigration officer in Singapore.

(6) The commander of an aircraft —

(a) if he disembarks any person in pursuance of subsection (5)(a), in the case of a Singapore-controlled aircraft, in any country or, in the case of any other aircraft, in Singapore, shall report the fact of, and the reasons for, that disembarkation to —

(i) an appropriate authority in the country of disembarkation; and

(ii) the appropriate diplomatic or consular office of the country of nationality of that person;

(b) if he intends to deliver any person in accordance with subsection (5)(b) in Singapore or, in the case of a Singapore-controlled aircraft, in any other country which is a Convention country, shall before or as soon as reasonably practicable after landing give notification of his intention and of the reasons therefor —

(i) where the country in question is Singapore, to a police officer or immigration officer or, in the case of any other country, to an officer having functions corresponding to the functions either of a police officer or of an immigration officer in Singapore; and

(ii) in either case to the appropriate diplomatic or consular office of the country of nationality of that person,

and any commander of an aircraft who without reasonable cause fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000.

### Provisions as to evidence in connection with aircraft

6\.—(1) Where in any proceeding before a court in Singapore for an offence committed on board an aircraft the testimony of any person is required and the court is satisfied that the person in question cannot be found in Singapore, there shall be admissible in evidence before that court any deposition relating to the subject matter of that proceeding previously made on oath by that person —

(a) in Singapore which was so made in the presence or absence of the person charged with the offence and before a District Judge or Magistrate; or

(b) outside Singapore which was so made in the presence or absence of the person charged with the offence and before a consular officer or a judicial officer of any foreign country.

(2) Any such deposition shall be authenticated by the signature of the District Judge, Magistrate, consular officer or judicial officer before whom it was made who shall certify that the person charged with the offence was present or absent at the taking of the deposition.

(3) It shall not be necessary in any proceeding to prove the signature or official character of the person appearing so to have authenticated any such deposition or to have given such certificate, and such certificate shall, unless the contrary is proved, be sufficient evidence in any proceeding that the person charged with the offence was present or absent (as the case may be) at the making of the deposition.

(4) If a complaint is made to a consular officer that any offence has been committed on a Singapore-controlled aircraft while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore, that officer may inquire into the case upon oath.

(5) In this section —

“deposition” includes any affidavit, affirmation or statement made upon oath; and

“oath” includes an affirmation or declaration in the case of persons allowed by law to affirm or declare instead of swearing,

and nothing in this section shall prejudice the admission as evidence of any deposition which is admissible in evidence apart from this section.
