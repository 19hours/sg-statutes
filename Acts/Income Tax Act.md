(iv) any person may elect that any sum of money or consideration deemed to be his income under this paragraph shall be apportioned in equal amounts to the year of assessment for which it would be deemed to be income but for this proviso and to any number of consecutive years of assessment immediately preceding such year, being years in respect of which additional assessments may be made under section 74(1) and not being in any case earlier than the year in the basis period for which the capital expenditure was incurred.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), where an interest in land is a tenancy and that tenancy comes to an end, that interest shall be deemed to have been transferred —

where C

is the amount of the capital expenditure still unallowed under this section in respect of that asset after the end of his tax relief period;

D

(a) ceases to belong to that person (whether on a sale of the machinery or plant or in any other circumstances of any description); or

(b) while continuing to belong to that person, permanently ceases to be used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by him in Singapore (whether by reason of the discontinuance of the trade, profession or business, or discontinuance of use of such machinery or plant in a trade, profession or business which continues to be carried on in Singapore),

an allowance or charge, to be known as a balancing allowance or a balancing charge, shall in the circumstances mentioned in this section be made to or, as the case may be, on that person for the year of assessment in the basis period for which that event occurs.

(1A) Where the property in machinery or plant passes at less than the open-market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing allowance or balancing charge the event shall be treated as if it had given rise to sale moneys of an amount equal to the open-market price of the machinery or plant.

(2) Where machinery or plant continues to belong to that person after the date on which it permanently ceases to be used for the purposes of a trade, profession or business carried on by him in Singapore, it shall be deemed to have been sold on the date of permanent cessation of use at the open-market price on that date.

(2A) Where there are no sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys or where the amount of the capital expenditure of the person in question on the provision of the plant or machinery still unallowed as at the time of the event exceeds those moneys, a balancing allowance shall be made, and the amount thereof shall be the amount of the expenditure still unallowed as aforesaid or, as the case may be, the excess thereof over those moneys.

(3) If the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys exceed the amount, if any, of the said expenditure still unallowed as at the time of the event, a balancing charge shall be made, and the amount on which it is made shall be an amount equal to the excess or, where the said amount still unallowed is nil, to those moneys.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3), in no case shall the amount on which a balancing charge is made on a person exceed —

where A

is the open-market price or sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys in respect of the motor car; and

B

is the capital expenditure incurred in respect of the motor car.

(5A) Notwithstanding anything in this section, no balancing allowance shall be made in respect of a motor car within the meaning of section 19(2B)(a) which is not, for any basis period after the basis period for the year of assessment 1981, registered as a business service passenger vehicle for the purposes of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276) and the rules made thereunder.

(2) If the amount on which the charge would have been made is greater than the capital expenditure on providing the new machinery or plant —

(a) the charge shall be made only on an amount equal to the difference;

[37/75; 9/80; 5/83]

(b) no initial allowance, no balancing allowance and no annual allowance shall be made or allowed in respect of the new machinery or plant or the expenditure on the provision thereof; and

(c) in considering whether any, and if so what, balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the expenditure on the new machinery or plant, there shall be deemed to have been made in respect of that expenditure an initial allowance equal to the full amount of that expenditure.

(3) If the capital expenditure on providing the new machinery or plant is equal to or greater than the amount on which the charge would have been made —

(a) the charge shall not be made;

(b) the amount of any initial allowance in respect of the said expenditure shall be calculated as if the expenditure had been reduced by the amount on which the charge would have been made;

(c) in considering what annual allowance is to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, there shall be left out of account a proportion of the machinery or plant equal to the proportion which the amount on which the charge would have been made bears to the amount of the said expenditure; and

(d) in considering whether any, and if so what, balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, the initial allowance in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been increased by an amount equal to the amount on which the charge would have been made.

(4) This section shall not apply to the provision of any new motor car for which no allowance is allowed by virtue of section 19(2C).

[13/84]

(2) No balance shall be added to and be deemed to form part of the corresponding allowance, if any, to be given to a company under subsection (1) unless the Comptroller is satisfied that the shareholders of the company on the last day of the year in which the allowances arose were substantially the same as the shareholders of the company on the first day of the year of assessment in which such allowances would otherwise be available under this section and such a balance shall not be allowed in any subsequent year of assessment.

[26/73]

(2A) The Minister or such person as he may appoint may, where there is a substantial change in the shareholders of a company and he is satisfied that such change is not for the purpose of deriving any tax benefit or obtaining any tax advantage, exempt that company from the provisions of subsection (2).

[3/89; 11/94]

(3) Upon such exemption the balance of the allowances referred to in subsection (1) may be added to and be deemed to form part of the corresponding allowance to be given to that company under that subsection but only for deduction against the gains or profits derived from the same trade or business in respect of which the allowances would have been made.

[3/89; 11/94]

(4) For the purpose of subsection (2) —

(a) the shareholders of a company at any date shall not be deemed to be substantially the same as the shareholders at any other date unless, on both those dates, not less than 50% of the paid-up capital of the company was held by or on behalf of the same persons, nor unless, on both those dates, not less than 50% of the nominal value of the allotted shares in the company were held by or on behalf of the same persons; and

(b) shares in a company held by or on behalf of another company shall be deemed to be held by the shareholders of the last-mentioned company, and shares held by or on behalf of the trustee of the estate of a deceased shareholder or by or on behalf of the person entitled to those shares as beneficiaries under the will or any intestacy of a deceased shareholder shall be deemed to be held by that deceased shareholder.

(c) notwithstanding anything in section 19A, where the sale is a sale of machinery or plant, the special allowances provided under that section shall continue to be available as if no sale had taken place; and

(d) notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this section or in sections 17 and 20, such balancing charge, if any, shall be made on the buyer on any event occurring after the date of the sale as would have fallen to be made on the seller if the seller had continued to own the property and had done all such things and been allowed all such allowances and deductions in connection therewith as were done by or allowed to the buyer.

[13/84]

(4) No election may be made under subsection (3) unless before the sale in the case of the seller and after the sale in the case of the buyer the property is used in the production of income chargeable under the provisions of this Act and unless the machinery or plant was not leased by the seller to the buyer before the sale.

(1A) A non-resident person shall be assessable and chargeable in respect of any income arising, directly or indirectly, through or from any attorneyship, factorship, agency, receivership, branch or management, and shall be so assessable and chargeable in the name of the attorney, factor, agent, receiver, branch or manager.

(2) A non-resident beneficiary of the estate of a deceased person shall, where the estate is being administered in Singapore, be assessable and chargeable in respect of the income received by or distributed to him or applied to his benefit in the name of the executor of the estate as if the executor were an agent of the non-resident beneficiary.

(2A) Where a non-resident person carries on business with a resident person and it appears to the Comptroller that owing to the close connection between the resident person and the non-resident person and to the substantial control exercised by the non-resident person over the resident person the course of business between those persons can be so arranged and is so arranged that the business done by the resident person in pursuance of his connection with the non-resident person produces to the resident person either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise from that business, the non-resident person shall be assessable and chargeable to tax in the name of the resident person as if the resident person were an agent of the non-resident person.

(3) Where the true amount of the gains or profits of any non-resident person chargeable with tax in the name of a resident person cannot in any case be readily ascertained the Comptroller may, if he thinks fit, assess and charge the non-resident person on a fair and reasonable percentage of the turnover of the business done by the non-resident person through or with the resident person in whose name he is chargeable as aforesaid, and in such case the provisions of this Act relating to the delivery of returns or particulars by persons acting on behalf of others shall extend so as to require returns or particulars to be furnished by the resident person of the business so done by the non-resident person through or with the resident person in the same manner as returns or particulars are to be delivered by persons acting for incapacitated or non-resident persons of income to be charged.

(5) The fact that a non-resident person executes sales or carries out transactions with other non-resident persons in circumstances which would make him chargeable in pursuance of subsections (2A) and (3) in the name of a resident person shall not of itself make him chargeable in respect of gains or profits arising from those sales or transactions.

(6) Where a non-resident person is chargeable to tax in the name of any attorney, factor, agent, receiver or manager, in respect of any gains or profits arising from the sale of goods or produce manufactured or produced outside Singapore by the non-resident person, the person in whose name the non-resident person is so chargeable may, if he thinks fit, apply to the Comptroller to have the assessment to tax in respect of those gains or profits made or amended on the basis of the profits which might reasonably be expected to have been earned by a merchant or, where the goods are retailed by or on behalf of the manufacturer or producer, by a retailer of the goods sold, who had bought from the manufacturer or producer direct, and on proof to the satisfaction of the Comptroller of the amount of the profits on the basis aforesaid, the assessment shall be made or amended accordingly.

(2) Where the income of a person is ascertained under section 27, the Comptroller may make an assessment in respect of any income of such person within the year in which the income is deemed to accrue.

(3) The Comptroller may, if he thinks fit, at any time during any year make an assessment in respect of the income derived by any person carrying on or exercising any trade, business, profession or vocation up to that year.

[11/94]

(3A) In making an assessment under subsection (3), the Comptroller may have regard to the estimate of chargeable income furnished under section 63 or he may make an assessment according to the best of his judgment where such estimate of chargeable income has not been furnished or has been rejected by him.

[5/77]

(4) Where the Comptroller has exercised his powers to make an advance assessment under this section, such assessment shall be made on the assumption that —

(a) the provisions of this Act in force during the year of assessment in which such assessment is made will continue in force for the year of assessment for which such assessment is made; and

(b) if such person so assessed is an individual, the personal circumstances of that person will be the same in the year of assessment as they were when such assessment is in fact made.

(5) If it appears to the Comptroller that by reason of such assumption an advance assessment so made has become less favourable to that person than it would have been if made under section 35(1), he shall amend such assessment as to him seems reasonable.

(6) Nothing in this section shall affect the Comptroller’s right to make any additional assessment due to any change of circumstances and without prejudice to the generality of section 74.

[72A

### Additional assessments

74\.—(1) Where it appears to the Comptroller that any person liable to tax has not been assessed or has been assessed at a less amount than that which ought to have been charged, the Comptroller may, within the year of assessment or within 6 years after the expiration thereof, assess that person at such amount or additional amount as according to his judgment ought to have been charged.

[11/94]

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), where, in the opinion of the Comptroller, any form of fraud or wilful default has been committed by or on behalf of any person in connection with or in relation to tax, the Comptroller may, for the purpose of making good any loss of tax attributable to fraud or wilful default, assess that person at any time.

(3) The provisions of this Act as to notice of assessment, appeal and other proceedings under this Act shall apply to any assessment or additional assessment made under subsection (1) or (2) and to tax charged thereunder.

(4) This section shall also apply, with the necessary modifications, to any assessment made under subsection (1) or (2) which results in any unabsorbed allowances or losses.

and in either case the Comptroller shall inform the person assessed to tax of his rights under subsections (2) and (3).

[32/99]

(2) If any person disputes the assessment, he may apply to the Comptroller, by notice of objection in writing, to review and to revise the assessment made upon him.

(b) summon any person who he thinks is able to give evidence respecting the assessment to attend before him and may examine that person on oath or otherwise.

(6) In the event of any person who has objected to an assessment made upon him —

(a) agreeing with the Comptroller as to the amount at which he is liable to be assessed, the assessment shall be amended accordingly, and notice of the revised assessment shall be served upon that person; or

(b) failing to agree with the Comptroller as to the amount at which he is liable to be assessed, the Comptroller shall, if any tax is payable, give him notice of refusal to amend the assessment as desired by that person and may revise the assessment to such amount as the Comptroller may determine, according to the best of his judgment, and the Comptroller shall give him notice of the revised assessment and of the tax payable together with notice of refusal to amend the revised assessment.

[32/99]

(7) Wherever requisite, any reference in this Act to an assessment or an additional assessment shall be construed as including a reference to an assessment or additional assessment as revised under subsection (6)(b).

77\.—(1) No assessment, warrant or other proceeding purporting to be made in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall be quashed, or deemed to be void or voidable, for want of form, or be affected by reason of a mistake, defect or omission therein, if it is in substance and effect in conformity with or according to the intent and meaning of this Act, and if the person assessed or intended to be assessed or affected thereby is designated therein according to common intent and understanding.

(2) An assessment shall not be impeached or affected —

(a) by reason of a mistake therein as to —

(4) Any refund to be made under this section shall be reduced by the amount of charge or additional charge which has not been utilized for set-off under section 44(11) on the date the refund arises, and where the amount of such charge or additional charge exceeds the amount to be refunded no refund shall be made under this section.

[1/88]

(5) Where through death, incapacity, bankruptcy, liquidation or other cause a person who would, but for such cause, have been entitled to make a claim under subsection (1) is unable to do so, his executor, trustee or receiver, as the case may be, shall be entitled to have refunded to him for the benefit of such person or his estate any tax paid in excess within the meaning of subsection (1).

(6) Where any such repayment relates to the income of a married woman chargeable in the name of her husband, such married woman shall be entitled, on application, to have refunded to her any tax paid by her, by deduction or otherwise, in excess within the meaning of subsection (1), where the Comptroller is satisfied that repayment to such married woman is reasonable.

(9) Where a refund is withheld under subsection (8), the Comptroller shall pay interest at the rate of 5% per annum with effect from the date of the order or decision appealed against on the amount of refund ultimately determined to be due as a result of any appeal.

### Relief in respect of error or mistake

93A\.—(1) If any person who has paid tax for any year of assessment alleges that an assessment is excessive by reason of some error or mistake in the return or statement made by him for the purposes of the assessment, he may, at any time not later than 6 years after the end of the year of assessment within which the assessment was made, make an application in writing to the Comptroller for relief.

(2) On receiving any such application, the Comptroller shall inquire into the matter and shall, subject to this section, give by way of repayment of tax such relief in respect of the error or mistake as appears to him to be reasonable and just.

(3) No relief shall be given under this section in respect of an error or mistake as to the basis on which the liability of the applicant ought to have been computed when the return or statement was in fact made on the basis of or in accordance with the practice of the Comptroller generally prevailing at the time when the return or statement was made.

(4) In determining any application under this section, the Comptroller shall have regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case, and in particular shall consider whether the granting of relief would result in the exclusion from charge to tax of income of the applicant, and for this purpose the Comptroller may take into consideration the liability of the applicant and assessments made upon him in respect of other years.

(5) Section 79 shall apply in respect of an appeal against a determination of the Comptroller under this section except that no such appeal shall be entertained until the sum of $250 has been deposited with the clerk to the Board of Review.

(6) The sum referred to in subsection (5) shall be refunded in the event of the appeal being allowed.

(7) The Board of Review may, if in its opinion the appeal was vexatious or frivolous, order that the whole or any part of the aforesaid sum shall be forfeited and awarded to the Comptroller as costs.
