### Advance assessments

73\.—(1) Notwithstanding section 72, where —

(a) in any year of assessment a person ceases to carry on a trade, business, profession, vocation or employment; or

(b) the Comptroller is of the opinion that any person possessing a source of income is about to leave Singapore and is likely to cease to possess that source in the year of assessment in which he leaves Singapore or in the following 2 years,

(b) if such person so assessed is an individual, the personal circumstances of that person will be the same in the year of assessment as they were when such assessment is in fact made.
