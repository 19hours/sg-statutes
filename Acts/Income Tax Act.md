### Balancing allowances and charges for machinery or plant

20\.—(1) Except as provided in this section, where at any time after the setting up and on or before the permanent discontinuance of a trade, profession or business, any event occurs whereby machinery or plant in respect of which allowances under section 19 or 19A have been made to a person carrying on a trade, profession or business —

(a) ceases to belong to that person (whether on a sale of the machinery or plant or in any other circumstances of any description); or

(b) while continuing to belong to that person —

(i) in a case where the machinery or plant which —

(A) was provided for any research and development undertaken by him directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on his behalf in Singapore; and

(B) was not provided for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by him,

permanently ceases to be used for any research and development undertaken by him directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on his behalf in Singapore, and is not used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by him; or

(ii) in any other case, permanently ceases to be used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by him in Singapore (whether by reason of the discontinuance of the trade, profession or business, or discontinuance of use of such machinery or plant in a trade, profession or business which continues to be carried on in Singapore),

an allowance or charge, to be known as a balancing allowance or a balancing charge, shall in the circumstances mentioned in this section be made to or, as the case may be, on that person for the year of assessment in the basis period for which that event occurs.

(1A) Where the property in machinery or plant passes at less than the open-market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing allowance or balancing charge the event shall be treated as if it had given rise to sale moneys of an amount equal to the open-market price of the machinery or plant.

(2) Where machinery or plant continues to belong to that person after the date on which it permanently ceases to be used for the purposes of a trade, profession or business carried on by him in Singapore, or (as the case may be) for the purpose of any research and development undertaken by him directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on his behalf in Singapore, it shall be deemed to have been sold on the date of permanent cessation of use at the open-market price on that date.

(2A) Where there are no sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys or where the amount of the capital expenditure of the person in question on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of the event exceeds those moneys, a balancing allowance shall be made, and the amount thereof shall be the amount of the expenditure still unallowed as aforesaid or, as the case may be, the excess thereof over those moneys.

(3) If the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys exceed the amount, if any, of the said expenditure still unallowed as at the time of the event, a balancing charge shall be made, and the amount on which it is made shall be an amount equal to the excess or, where the said amount still unallowed is nil, to those moneys.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3), in no case shall the amount on which a balancing charge is made on a person exceed —

(a) the aggregate of the initial allowance, if any, and the annual allowances, if any, made to him under section 19 in respect of the expenditure in question; and

(b) the special allowances, if any, made to him under section 19A in respect of the expenditure in question.

[13/84]

(5) Notwithstanding anything in this section but subject to subsection (6A), where a balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made under subsection (1) in respect of a motor car to which section 19(3) applies, the sum to be taken in lieu of the open- market price or sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys for the purpose of calculating such balancing allowance or charge shall be ascertained in accordance with the formula

where A

is the open-market price or sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys in respect of the motor car; and

B

is the capital expenditure incurred in respect of the motor car.

[37/75; 9/80; 5/83; 49/2004]

(6A) Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act (Cap. 86), where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the trade, profession or business, for which purpose the machinery or plant is provided, produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, and any balancing allowance or balancing charge arises to be made —

(a) the balancing allowance shall be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances; and

(b) such proportion of the balancing charge shall be exempt from tax as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances.

[49/2004]

(6B) Section 14D(4) and (5) shall apply in relation to the balancing allowance to be made to a person under subsection (1)(b)(i) as they apply in relation to the deduction of the expenditure and payments referred to in section 14D(1)(aa) and (c), subject to the following modifications:

(a) a reference to the amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to the amount of the balancing allowance;

(b) a reference to unabsorbed losses is a reference to unabsorbed allowances; and

(c) a reference to a specified amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to an amount computed in accordance with the following formula:

where A

is the amount of the balancing allowance that could have been made against the income of the person under subsection (1)(b)(i) if the income had been subject to tax at the rate specified in section 43(1)(a);

B

is the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a); and

C

(ii)

in a case where the concessionary income derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by him is subject to tax at 2 or more concessionary rates of tax, the higher or highest of those rates.

(6C) Notwithstanding anything in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act (Cap. 86), where a balancing charge falls to be made on a person under subsection (1)(b)(i), the amount of the charge shall be deemed to be income of that person that is chargeable to tax at the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a).

(7) In this section, “open-market price”, in relation to any machinery or plant, means the price which the machinery or plant would have fetched if sold in the open market at the time of the event in question; except that where the Comptroller is satisfied by reason of the special nature of any machinery or plant that it is not practicable to determine an open-market price, he may adopt such other value as appears to him to be reasonable in the circumstances.

(a) the charge shall be made only on an amount equal to the difference;

(b) no initial allowance, no balancing allowance and no annual allowance shall be made or allowed in respect of the new machinery or plant or the expenditure on the provision thereof; and

(c) in considering whether any, and if so what, balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the expenditure on the new machinery or plant, there shall be deemed to have been made in respect of that expenditure an initial allowance equal to the full amount of that expenditure.

(3) If the capital expenditure on providing the new machinery or plant is equal to or greater than the amount on which the charge would have been made —

(a) the charge shall not be made;

(b) the amount of any initial allowance in respect of the said expenditure shall be calculated as if the expenditure had been reduced by the amount on which the charge would have been made;

(c) in considering what annual allowance is to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, there shall be left out of account a proportion of the machinery or plant equal to the proportion which the amount on which the charge would have been made bears to the amount of the said expenditure; and

(d) in considering whether any, and if so what, balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, the initial allowance in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been increased by an amount equal to the amount on which the charge would have been made.

(4) This section shall not apply to the provision of any new motor car for which no allowance is allowed by virtue of section 19(5).

[32/99]

(5) For the purpose of this section, where the capital expenditure incurred in providing a new motor car registered outside Singapore and used exclusively outside Singapore exceeds $35,000, the expenditure incurred shall be deemed to be $35,000.

### Advance assessments

73\.—(1) Notwithstanding section 72, where —

(a) in any year of assessment a person ceases to carry on a trade, business, profession, vocation or employment; or

(b) the Comptroller is of the opinion that any person possessing a source of income is about to leave Singapore and is likely to cease to possess that source in the year of assessment in which he leaves Singapore or in the following 2 years,
