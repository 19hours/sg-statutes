(2) Any arrangements made with the government of another country —

(a) may provide for liability to tax by one country and for exemption from tax by the other country;

(3) The credit shall not exceed the amount which would be produced by computing the amount of the income in accordance with the provisions of this Act and then charging it to income tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the income tax chargeable (before allowance of credit under any arrangements having effect under section 49) on the assessable income of the person entitled to the income by the amount of his assessable income; and in any case where the rate exceeds 28% it shall be regarded as 28%.

(b) where the income tax chargeable depends on the amount received in Singapore, that amount shall be increased by the appropriate amount of the foreign tax in respect of the income;

(c) where the income includes a dividend and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the income shall be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable which falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit; but notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this subsection a deduction shall be allowed of any amount by which the foreign tax in respect of the income exceeds the credit therefor.

(6) Subsection (5)(a) and (b) shall apply to the computation of assessable income for the purposes of determining the rate mentioned in subsection (3), and shall apply thereto in relation to all income in the case of which credit falls to be given for foreign tax under arrangements for the time being in force under section 49.

(4) Where under arrangements for the time being in force under section 49 with the government of any territory outside Singapore no provision is made for tax credit in respect of income out of which any dividend is paid by a company resident in that territory, tax credit under section 50 in respect of such income shall be given to any person resident in Singapore who owns not less than 25% of the shares of the company paying the dividend.

(5) Section 50 shall, with the necessary modifications and subject to any regulations made under subsection (1)(a), apply for the purposes of this section as if any territory to which this section and the regulations have effect were a territory with which arrangements have been made under section 49.

(2A) Where a non-resident person carries on business with a resident person and it appears to the Comptroller that owing to the close connection between the resident person and the non-resident person and to the substantial control exercised by the non-resident person over the resident person the course of business between those persons can be so arranged and is so arranged that the business done by the resident person in pursuance of his connection with the non-resident person produces to the resident person either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise from that business, the non-resident person shall be assessable and chargeable to tax in the name of the resident person as if the resident person were an agent of the non-resident person.

(2) Every claim for repayment under this section shall be made within 6 years from the end of the year of assessment to which the claim relates.

(4) Any refund to be made under this section shall be reduced by the amount of charge or additional charge which has not been utilized for set off under section 44(11) on the date the refund arises, and where the amount of such charge or additional charge exceeds the amount to be refunded no refund shall be made under this section.

[1/88]

(5) Where through death, incapacity, bankruptcy, liquidation or other cause a person who would, but for such cause, have been entitled to make a claim under subsection (1) is unable to do so, his executor, trustee or receiver, as the case may be, shall be entitled to have refunded to him for the benefit of such person or his estate any tax paid in excess within the meaning of subsection (1).

(2) On receiving any such application, the Comptroller shall inquire into the matter and shall, subject to this section, give by way of repayment of tax such relief in respect of the error or mistake as appears to him to be reasonable and just.

(3) No relief shall be given under this section in respect of an error or mistake as to the basis on which the liability of the applicant ought to have been computed when the return or statement was in fact made on the basis of or in accordance with the practice of the Comptroller generally prevailing at the time when the return or statement was made.

(4) In determining any application under this section, the Comptroller shall have regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case, and in particular shall consider whether the granting of relief would result in the exclusion from charge to tax of income of the applicant, and for this purpose the Comptroller may take into consideration the liability of the applicant and assessments made upon him in respect of other years.

(5) Section 79 shall apply in respect of an appeal against a determination of the Comptroller under this section except that no such appeal shall be entertained until the sum of $250 has been deposited with the clerk to the Board of Review.
