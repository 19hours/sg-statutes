[7/79]

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) —

(a) where 2 basis periods overlap, the period common to both shall be deemed to fall in the first basis period only;

(b) where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for a year of assessment and the commencement of a basis period for the next succeeding year of assessment, then, unless the second-mentioned year of assessment is the year of the permanent discontinuance of the trade, the interval shall be deemed to be part of the second basis period; and

(c) where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for the year of assessment preceding that in which the trade is permanently discontinued and the commencement of the basis period for the year in which it is permanently discontinued, the interval shall be deemed to form part of the first basis period.

an allowance or a charge, to be known as a balancing allowance or a balancing charge, shall in the circumstances mentioned in this section be made to or, as the case may be, on that person for the year of assessment in the basis period for which that event occurs.

[34/2008]

(1A) Where the property in machinery or plant passes at less than the open-market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing allowance or balancing charge the event shall be treated as if it had given rise to sale moneys of an amount equal to the open-market price of the machinery or plant.

(2) Where machinery or plant continues to belong to that person after the date on which it permanently ceases to be used for the purposes of a trade, profession or business carried on by him in Singapore, or (as the case may be) for the purpose of any research and development undertaken by him directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on his behalf in Singapore, it shall be deemed to have been sold on the date of permanent cessation of use at the open-market price on that date.

[34/2008]

(2A) Where there are no sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys or where the amount of the capital expenditure of the person in question on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of the event exceeds those moneys, a balancing allowance shall be made, and the amount thereof shall be the amount of the expenditure still unallowed as aforesaid or, as the case may be, the excess thereof over those moneys.

(3) If the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys exceed the amount, if any, of the said expenditure still unallowed as at the time of the event, a balancing charge shall be made, and the amount on which it is made shall be an amount equal to the excess or, where the said amount still unallowed is nil, to those moneys.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3), in no case shall the amount on which a balancing charge is made on a person exceed —

(a) the aggregate of the initial allowance, if any, and the annual allowances, if any, made to him under section 19 in respect of the expenditure in question; and

(b) the special allowances, if any, made to him under section 19A in respect of the expenditure in question.

[13/84]

(5) Notwithstanding anything in this section but subject to subsection (6A), where a balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made under subsection (1) in respect of a motor car to which section 19(3) applies, the sum to be taken in lieu of the open‑market price or sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys for the purpose of calculating such balancing allowance or charge shall be ascertained in accordance with the formula

where A

is the open-market price or sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys in respect of the motor car; and

B

is the capital expenditure incurred in respect of the motor car.

[37/75; 9/80; 5/83; 49/2004]

[9/80; 1/98]

(6A) Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act (Cap. 86), where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the trade, profession or business, for which purpose the machinery or plant is provided, produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, and any balancing allowance or balancing charge arises to be made —

(a) the balancing allowance shall be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances; and

(b) such proportion of the balancing charge shall be exempt from tax as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances.

[49/2004]

(6B) Section 14D(4) and (5) shall apply in relation to the balancing allowance to be made to a person under subsection (1)(b)(i) as they apply in relation to the deduction of the expenditure and payments referred to in section 14D(1)(aa), (c) and (f), subject to the following modifications:

(a) a reference to the amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to the amount of the balancing allowance;

(b) a reference to unabsorbed losses is a reference to unabsorbed allowances; and

(c) a reference to a specified amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to an amount computed in accordance with the following formula:

where A

is the amount of the balancing allowance that could have been made against the income of the person under subsection (1)(b)(i) if the income had been subject to tax at the rate specified in section 43(1)(a);

B

is the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a); and

C

(ii)

in a case where the concessionary income derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by him is subject to tax at 2 or more concessionary rates of tax, the higher or highest of those rates.

[34/2008; 29/2012]

(6C) Notwithstanding anything in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, where a balancing charge falls to be made on a person under subsection (1)(b)(i), the amount of the charge shall be deemed to be income of that person that is chargeable to tax at the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a).

[34/2008]

(7) In this section, “open-market price”, in relation to any machinery or plant, means the price which the machinery or plant would have fetched if sold in the open market at the time of the event in question; except that where the Comptroller is satisfied by reason of the special nature of any machinery or plant that it is not practicable to determine an open-market price, he may adopt such other value as appears to him to be reasonable in the circumstances.

### Replacement of machinery or plant

21\.—(1) Where machinery or plant in the case of which any of the events mentioned in section 20(1) has occurred is replaced by the owner thereof and a balancing charge falls to be made on him by reason of that event or, but for this section, would have fallen to be made on him by reason thereof, then, if by notice in writing to the Comptroller he so elects, this section shall have effect.

(a) the charge shall be made only on an amount equal to the difference;

(b) no initial allowance, no balancing allowance and no annual allowance shall be made or allowed in respect of the new machinery or plant or the expenditure on the provision thereof; and

(c) in considering whether any, and if so what, balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the expenditure on the new machinery or plant, there shall be deemed to have been made in respect of that expenditure an initial allowance equal to the full amount of that expenditure.

(3) If the capital expenditure on providing the new machinery or plant is equal to or greater than the amount on which the charge would have been made —

(a) the charge shall not be made;

(b) the amount of any initial allowance in respect of the said expenditure shall be calculated as if the expenditure had been reduced by the amount on which the charge would have been made;

(c) in considering what annual allowance is to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, there shall be left out of account a proportion of the machinery or plant equal to the proportion which the amount on which the charge would have been made bears to the amount of the said expenditure; and

(d) in considering whether any, and if so what, balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, the initial allowance in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been increased by an amount equal to the amount on which the charge would have been made.

(4) This section shall not apply to the provision of any new motor car for which no allowance is allowed by virtue of section 19(5).

[32/99]

(5) For the purpose of this section, where the capital expenditure incurred in providing, in the basis period for the year of assessment 2013 or any preceding year of assessment, a new motor car registered outside Singapore and used exclusively outside Singapore exceeds $35,000, the expenditure incurred shall be deemed to be $35,000.

the Comptroller may, at any time, for the purposes of making good any loss of tax attributable to the deduction or part thereof, assess the person who has utilised the deduction at such amount or additional amount as according to his judgment ought to have been charged, and this subsection shall also apply with the necessary modifications to any assessment which results in any unabsorbed allowances or losses.

[29/2010]

### Regulations

(24) The Minister may make regulations —

(a) to provide for the disallowance of or for the adjustments to be made to the amount of any deduction allowed in any year of assessment under this section where the acquiring company or the acquiring subsidiary, as the case may be, divests of any of the ordinary shares it holds in the target company;

37M\.—(1) If —

(a) any donation allowable under this Act for the year of assessment 2012 or any preceding year of assessment (referred to in this section as the attributed donation) is to be deducted from any income of a company under a provision of this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act (Cap. 86) in determining the amount of its income that is exempt from tax under that provision for that or any subsequent year of assessment; and

(v) where the part of the balance that may be deducted under paragraph (i) against any type of income in accordance with subsection (2) has been so deducted and a sum remains of that part of the balance after such deduction, a deduction under paragraph (ii) of the sum that so remains, or any sum that remains after one or more applications of this paragraph, shall be made in the following manner:

(B) any sum remaining after that deduction shall be deducted against any other type of income in accordance with section 37B;

(vi) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii), the balance shall be disregarded if the Comptroller is not satisfied that the shareholders of the company on the last day of the year in which the donation was made, were substantially the same as the shareholders of the company on the first day of the year of assessment in which the balance would otherwise be deductible; and

(vii) section 37(13) to (17) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, for the purposes of paragraph (vi).

(e) if the company only derives income that is exempt from tax for that year of assessment, then section 37B(3) shall, with the necessary modifications, apply for the purpose of making a deduction of the balance under subsection (1)(ii) as if the balance were unabsorbed donation in respect of income of a company subject to tax at the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a).

(2) Any arrangements made with the government of another country —

(a) may provide for liability to tax by one country and for exemption from tax by the other country;

(b) may provide for exemption, wholly or partly and with or without conditions, from tax in either or both countries and for any income so exempted to be taken into account in determining the effective rate of tax to be applicable to other income;

(3) The credit shall not exceed the amount which would be produced by computing the amount of the income in accordance with the provisions of this Act and then charging it to income tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the income tax chargeable (before allowance of credit under any arrangements having effect under section 49) on the assessable income of the person entitled to the income by the amount of his assessable income.

(c) where the income includes a dividend and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the income shall be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable which falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit.

[53/2007]

(6) Subsection (5)(a) and (b) shall apply to the computation of assessable income for the purposes of determining the rate mentioned in subsection (3), and shall apply thereto in relation to all income in the case of which credit falls to be given for foreign tax under arrangements for the time being in force under section 49.

(b) a dividend is paid which is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide,

then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than one-half of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, credit shall be allowed as if the dividend were a dividend of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide.

(2A) Where a non-resident person carries on business with a resident person and it appears to the Comptroller that owing to the close connection between the resident person and the non‑resident person and to the substantial control exercised by the non‑resident person over the resident person the course of business between those persons can be so arranged and is so arranged that the business done by the resident person in pursuance of his connection with the non‑resident person produces to the resident person either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise from that business, the non-resident person shall be assessable and chargeable to tax in the name of the resident person as if the resident person were an agent of the non‑resident person.
