### Conditions for grant of protection

22\.—(1) For the purpose of sections 16(2), 21(2)(b)(iii) and 25(2)(a) —

(a) a plant variety is new if harvested or propagating material of the plant variety has not been sold or otherwise disposed of to another person, by or with the consent of the breeder for the purposes of exploitation of the plant variety —

(i) earlier than 12 months before the date the application is made, where the sale or disposal and the exploitation of the plant variety is in Singapore; and

(ii) earlier than 6 years before that date in the case of trees or vines, or earlier than 4 years before that date in any other case, where the sale or disposal and the exploitation of the plant variety is outside Singapore;

(b) a plant variety is distinct if it is clearly distinguishable from any other plant variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge at the time of the making of the application;

(c) a plant variety is stable if its relevant characteristics remain unchanged after repeated propagation or, in the case of a particular cycle of propagation, at the end of each cycle; and

(d) a plant variety is uniform if, subject to the variation that may be expected from the particular features of its propagation, it is sufficiently uniform in its relevant characteristics.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), where, in order to increase the stock of a plant variety or for any testing of a plant variety, the breeder of the plant variety makes any arrangement under which —

(a) propagating material of that plant variety is to be sold to or used by some other person; and

(b) any unused portion of that propagating material, and all the material of any type produced from that propagating material, is —

(i) to be sold to the breeder by that other person; or

(ii) otherwise to become the property of the breeder,

no account shall be taken of any sale or disposal under that arrangement.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a plant variety does not cease to be new by virtue only of the sale or disposal at any time of —

(a) a grant of protection in respect of a plant variety; or

(b) the entering of a plant variety in an official register of plant varieties,

shall be deemed to render that plant variety a matter of common knowledge from the date of application, provided that the application leads to a grant of protection in respect of that plant variety or to the entering of that plant variety in the official register of plant varieties, as the case may be.

(c) the grant of protection has been made to a person who is not entitled to it, unless it has since been transferred to the person who is so entitled.

[HK Plant Ord. 1997, s. 25; ICPNVP 1991 Art. 14 (1) and (2)]

### Essentially derived and certain other plant varieties

29\.—(1) Where a grant of protection is made under section 21, that grant of protection shall also extend to —

(a) not being entitled by any licence or transfer or otherwise, does in Singapore, or authorises the doing in Singapore of, any act specified in section 28(1) in respect of any propagating material or harvested material of a protected variety;

(b) where propagating material of the protected variety has been imported into Singapore, propagates, sells or uses that material as propagating material without the authority of the grantee concerned; or

(c) imports into Singapore, without the consent of the grantee —

(i) from a country that is not a UPOV member, any harvested material of the protected variety; or

(ii) from a UPOV member, any harvested material of the protected variety in respect of which it is not possible to make the equivalent of a grant of protection under the law of that member.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the relief that the Court may grant in an action for an infringement of a grant of protection includes an injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the Court thinks fit) and either damages or an account of profits.

(c) any act for the purposes of breeding any other plant variety and, except in the case of an essentially derived or other plant variety to which the grant of protection is extended by virtue of section 29(1), any act that requires the authorisation of the grantee under section 28(1) in respect of such other variety.

(2) It is not an infringement of a grant of protection for any person engaging in farming activities to use, for propagating purposes and for the purpose of safeguarding agricultural or horticultural production, on his own holdings, harvested material from the protected variety where —

(a) the genera or species within which the protected variety is classified has been prescribed for the purposes of this section as exempt from the rights of a grantee; and

(b) the harvested material —

(i) has been obtained by purchase or otherwise with the authority of the grantee concerned; or

(a) propagating material of any kind; and

(a) the extent to which the protected variety may be exploited; and

(b) the right of the licensee to obtain propagating material from the grantee to the extent reasonable.

35\.—(1) Where an applicant sells any propagating material of the plant variety in respect of which his application relates, he shall take all reasonable steps, by means of suitable labeling or other identification of that material to inform the purchaser of the existence of his application, unless and until his application is withdrawn or lapses or the Registrar declines to make a grant in respect of that application.

(2) Any person who —

(a) has acquired any rights in respect of any plant variety under section 21, or who is a licensee of such rights; and

(3) In determining, for the purposes of section 30(4), whether or not any person had reasonable grounds for supposing that any action was an infringement of a grant of protection, the Court may take into account the extent, if any, to which a person referred to in subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, has complied with that subsection in respect of any propagating material in relation to which that infringement occurred.

[HK Plant Ord. 1997, s. 28]

## PART VIII

DENOMINATION

(3) The Registrar shall not approve or register a denomination for the plant variety which —

(a) consists solely of figures, except where this is an established practice for designating plant varieties;

(b) is likely to mislead or cause confusion concerning the characteristics, value or identity of the plant variety, or the identity of the breeder;

(c) is contrary to any written law or public order, or is likely to be offensive to the public;

(d) is likely to cause confusion with a trade mark, a name, a business or any other rights for which any person other than the applicant enjoys protection under any law; or

(4) Where a denomination for a plant variety has previously been submitted in any UPOV member other than Singapore for the purpose of registration in that UPOV member, the denomination submitted for the purpose of an application in Singapore in respect of that plant variety must be the same as the denomination submitted in the UPOV member.

(5) The Registrar shall approve the denomination submitted under subsection (4) upon the grant of protection, unless the Registrar considers the denomination to be unsuitable for use within Singapore.

(b) the registered denomination of the protected variety is still in use in respect of the commercial exploitation of the protected variety, even if the term of the grant of protection has expired.

(4) A person who sells or markets the propagating material or harvested material of a protected variety may, for that purpose, associate a trade mark, trade name or other similar indication which he owns with the registered denomination of that protected variety.

(5) Where a person associates a trade mark, trade name or other similar indication with the registered denomination under subsection (4), the denomination must nevertheless be easily recognisable and distinct from the trade mark, trade name or other similar indication.
