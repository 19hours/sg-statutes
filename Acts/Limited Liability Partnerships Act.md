(3) Subsections (1) and (2) shall not affect the personal liability of a partner in tort for his own wrongful act or omission, but a partner shall not be personally liable for the wrongful act or omission of any other partner of the limited liability partnership.

(4) Where a partner of a limited liability partnership is liable to any person (other than another partner of the limited liability partnership) as a result of a wrongful act or omission of his in the course of the business of the limited liability partnership or with its authority, the limited liability partnership is liable to the same extent as the partner.

(5) The liabilities of the limited liability partnership shall be met out of the property of the limited liability partnership.

(b) the person knows that he has no authority or does not know or believe him to be a partner of the limited liability partnership.

(3) Where a person has ceased to be a partner of a limited liability partnership, the former partner is to be regarded (in relation to any person dealing with the limited liability partnership) as still being a partner of the limited liability partnership unless —

(b) determined as at the date the former partner ceased to be a partner.

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a former partner, his personal representative or its liquidator (as the case may be) shall not interfere in the management of the limited liability partnership.

[Delaware RUPA, s. 15-701 (a) and (b); UK LLP 2000, s. 4 (3)]

### Bankruptcy of partner

12\. Unless otherwise provided in the limited liability partnership agreement, if a partner of a limited liability partnership is adjudicated a bankrupt by a court in Singapore or elsewhere —

(a) his bankruptcy shall not by itself cause him to cease being a partner of the limited liability partnership, but the restriction on him being a manager of the limited liability partnership under section 33 applies; and

(b) the Official Assignee or trustee of the estate of the bankrupt partner shall not interfere in the management of the limited liability partnership but shall be entitled to receive distributions from the limited liability partnership that the bankrupt partner is entitled to receive under the limited liability partnership agreement.

### Assignment of partner’s interest in distributions

13\.—(1) Unless otherwise provided in the limited liability partnership agreement, a partner may assign the whole or any part of his interest in the limited liability partnership but only to the extent that the assignee becomes entitled to receive distributions from the limited liability partnership that the partner would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

(2) An assignment under subsection (1) shall not by itself —

(a) cause the partner to cease being a partner of the limited liability partnership; and

(b) entitle the assignee to interfere in the management of the limited liability partnership.

### Power to refuse registration

(4) Notwithstanding anything in this section, where the Registrar is satisfied that a limited liability partnership has been registered (whether through inadvertence or otherwise and whether originally or by a change of name) under a name which —

(a) is a name referred to in subsection (1); or

(b) so nearly resembles the name of any other limited liability partnership or corporation or a business name as to be likely to be mistaken for it, the Registrar may direct the limited liability partnership to change its name, and the limited liability partnership shall comply with the direction within 6 weeks after the date of the direction or such longer period as the Registrar may allow, unless the direction is annulled by the Minister.

(5) Any person may apply, in writing, to the Registrar to give a direction to any limited liability partnership, on a ground referred to in subsection (4)(a) or (b), to change its name.

(9) Any limited liability partnership aggrieved by a direction of the Registrar under subsection (4) or a requirement of the Registrar under subsection (8) may, within 30 days of the date of the direction or requirement, appeal to the Minister whose decision shall be final.

77.—(1) Subject to this paragraph and paragraphs 79 and 81, where a limited liability partnership is wound up and it has at the relevant time (as defined in paragraph 79) entered into a transaction with any person at an undervalue, the Official Assignee may apply to the Court for an order under this paragraph.

(2) The Court shall, on such an application, make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that limited liability partnership had not entered into that transaction.

(3) The Court shall not make an order under sub-paragraph (2) in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that —

(a) the limited liability partnership which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business; and

(b) that at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the limited liability partnership.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs 79 and 81, a limited liability partnership enters into a transaction with a person at an undervalue if —

(a) it makes a gift to that person or it otherwise enters into a transaction with that person on terms that provide for it to receive no consideration; or

(b) it enters into a transaction with that person for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by the limited liability partnership.

Unfair preferences

78.—(1) Subject to this paragraph and paragraphs 79 and 81, where a limited liability partnership is wound up and it has, at the relevant time (as defined in paragraph 79), given an unfair preference to any person, the Official Assignee may apply to the Court for an order under this paragraph.

(2) The Court shall, on such an application, make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that limited liability partnership had not given that unfair preference.

(3) For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs 79 and 81, a limited liability partnership gives an unfair preference to a person if —

(a) that person is one of the limited liability partnership’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for any of its debts or other liabilities; and

(b) the limited liability partnership does anything or suffers anything to be done which (in either case) has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of the limited liability partnership’s liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done.

(4) The Court shall not make an order under this paragraph in respect of an unfair preference given to any person unless the limited liability partnership which gave the preference was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce in relation to that person the effect mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(b).

(5) A limited liability partnership which has given an unfair preference to a person connected with the limited liability partnership (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee) at the time the unfair preference was given shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to have been influenced in deciding to give it by such a desire as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (4).

(6) The fact that something has been done in pursuance of the order of a court does not, without more, prevent the doing or suffering of that thing from constituting the giving of an unfair preference.

(7) This paragraph shall apply without prejudice to the operation of paragraph 85.

Relevant time under paragraphs 77 and 78

79.—(1) Subject to this paragraph, the time at which a limited liability partnership enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives an unfair preference shall be a relevant time if the transaction is entered into or the preference given —

(c) in any other case of an unfair preference which is not a transaction at an undervalue, within the period of 6 months ending on that day.

(2) Where a limited liability partnership enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives an unfair preference at a time mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c), that time is not a relevant time for the purposes of paragraphs 77 and 78 unless the limited liability partnership —

(a) is insolvent at that time; or

(b) becomes insolvent in consequence of the transaction or preference.

(3) Where a transaction is entered into at an undervalue by a limited liability partnership with a person who is connected to the limited liability partnership (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee), the requirements under sub-paragraph (2) shall be presumed to be satisfied unless the contrary is shown.

(2) An order under paragraph 77 or 78 may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person with whom the limited liability partnership in question entered into the transaction or, as the case may be, the person to whom the unfair preference was given.

(3) An order under paragraph 77 or 78 shall not —

(a) prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than that limited liability partnership and was acquired in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest; or

(b) which results in the limited liability partnership becoming insolvent and knew or ought to have known at the time of distribution that the limited liability partnership would become insolvent as a result of the distribution, shall be personally liable to the limited liability partnership for the amount or value of the distribution if it was received within a period of 3 years before the commencement of the winding up of the limited liability partnership.

(3) Where any partner or former partner has made a payment to discharge his liability under sub-paragraph (1), the amount of the payment shall constitute a debt due from the limited liability partnership to such partner or former partner, and paragraph 47 shall apply to such debt but only after all the liabilities of the limited liability partnership (excluding the debts arising under this sub-paragraph) have been discharged and settled in full.

Liquidator’s right to recover in respect of certain sales to or by limited liability partnership

(d) from a firm of which, at the time of the acquisition, a partner was also a manager of the limited liability partnership, the liquidator may recover from the person, limited liability partnership, corporation or firm from which the property, business or undertaking was acquired any amount by which the cash consideration for the acquisition exceeded the value of the property, business or undertaking at the time of its acquisition.

(2) Where any property, business or undertaking has been sold by a limited liability partnership for a cash consideration within a period of 2 years before the commencement of the winding up of the limited liability partnership —

(d) from a firm of which, at the time of the sale, a partner was also a manager of the limited liability partnership,

the liquidator may recover from the person, limited liability partnership, corporation or firm to which the property, business or undertaking was sold any amount by which the value of the property, business or undertaking at the time of the sale exceeded the cash consideration.

(3) For the purposes of this paragraph, the value of the property, business or undertaking includes the value of any goodwill or profits which might have been made from the business or undertaking or similar considerations.

(4) In this paragraph, “cash consideration”, in relation to an acquisition or sale by a limited liability partnership, means consideration for such acquisition or sale payable otherwise than as contribution of capital to the limited liability partnership.

Disclaimer of onerous property

86.—(1) Where any part of the property of a limited liability partnership consists of —

(a) any estate or interest in land which is burdened with onerous covenants;

(b) shares or interests in corporations;

(c) unprofitable contracts; or

(d) any other property that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by reason of its binding the possessor thereof to the performance of any onerous act, or to the payment of any sum of money,

the liquidator of the limited liability partnership, notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of the property or exercised any act of ownership in relation thereto, may, with the leave of the Court or the committee of inspection and, subject to this paragraph, by writing signed by him, at any time within 12 months after the commencement of the winding up or such extended period as is allowed by the Court, disclaim the property; but where any such property has not come to the knowledge of the liquidator within one month after the commencement of the winding up, the power of disclaiming may be exercised at any time within 12 months after he has become aware thereof or such extended period as is allowed by the Court.

(2) The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as from the date of disclaimer, the rights, interest and liabilities of the limited liability partnership and the property of the limited liability partnership in or in respect of the property disclaimed, but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the limited liability partnership and the property of the limited liability partnership from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

(3) The Court or the committee before or on granting leave to disclaim may require such notices to be given to persons interested, and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and make such other order in the matter as the Court or committee thinks just.

(4) The liquidator shall not be entitled to disclaim if an application in writing has been made to him by any person interested in the property requiring him to decide whether he will or will not disclaim, and the liquidator has not, within a period of 28 days after the receipt of the application or such further period as is allowed by the Court or the committee, given notice to the applicant that he intends to apply to the Court or the committee for leave to disclaim, and, in the case of a contract, if the liquidator after such an application in writing does not within that period or further period disclaim the contract, the liquidator shall be deemed to have adopted it.

(5) The Court may, on the application of a person who is, as against the liquidator, entitled to the benefit or subject to the burden of a contract made with the limited liability partnership, make an order rescinding the contract on such terms as to payment by or to either party of damages for the non-performance of the contract, or otherwise as the Court thinks just, and any damages payable under the order to that person may be proved by him as a debt in the winding up.

(6) The Court may, on the application of a person who either claims any interest in any disclaimed property or is under any liability not discharged by this Act in respect of any disclaimed property and on hearing such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for the vesting of the property in or the delivery of the property to any person entitled thereto, or to whom it seems just that the property should be delivered by way of compensation for such liability as aforesaid, or a trustee for him, and on such terms as the Court thinks just, and on any such vesting order being made and a copy thereof and an office copy thereof being lodged with the Registrar and the Official Receiver, respectively, and if the order relates to land with the appropriate authority concerned with the recording or registration of dealings in that land, as the case requires, the property comprised therein shall vest accordingly in the person therein named in that behalf without any further conveyance, transfer or assignment.

(7) Notwithstanding anything in sub-paragraph (6), where the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature, the Court shall not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the limited liability partnership, whether as under-lessee or as mortgagee, except upon the terms of making that person —

(a) subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those to which the limited liability partnership was subject under the lease in respect of the property at the commencement of the winding up; or

(b) if the Court thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been assigned to that person at that date,

and in either event, if the case so requires, as if the lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order, and any under-lessee or mortgagee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms shall be excluded from all interest in and security upon the property, and, if there is no person claiming under the limited liability partnership who is willing to accept an order upon such terms, the Court may vest the estate and interest of the limited liability partnership in the property in any person liable personally or in a representative character and either alone or jointly with the limited liability partnership to perform the lessee’s covenants in the lease, freed and discharged from all estates, incumbrances and interests created therein by the limited liability partnership.

(8) Any person injured by the operation of a disclaimer under this paragraph shall be deemed to be a creditor of the limited liability partnership to the amount of the injury, and may accordingly prove the amount as a debt in the winding up.

Interpretation

87. In paragraphs 88 and 89 —

“goods” includes all chattels personal;

“bailiff” includes any officer charged with the execution of a writ or other process.

Restriction of rights of creditor as to execution or attachment

88.—(1) Where a creditor has issued execution against the goods or land of a limited liability partnership or has attached any debt due to the limited liability partnership and the limited liability partnership is subsequently wound up, he shall not be entitled to retain the benefit of the execution or attachment against the liquidator unless he has completed the execution or attachment before the date of the commencement of the winding up, but —

(a) where any creditor has had notice of a meeting having been called at which a resolution for voluntary winding up is to be proposed, the date on which the creditor so had notice shall for the purposes of this paragraph be substituted for the date of the commencement of the winding up;

(b) a person who purchases in good faith under a sale by the bailiff any goods of a limited liability partnership on which an execution has been levied shall in all cases acquire a good title to them against the liquidator; and

(c) the rights conferred by this sub-paragraph on the liquidator may be set aside by the Court in favour of the creditor to such extent and subject to such terms as the Court thinks fit.

(2) For the purposes of this paragraph —

(a) an execution against goods is completed by seizure and sale;

(b) an attachment of a debt is completed by receipt of the debt; and

(c) an execution against land is completed by sale or, in the case of an equitable interest, by the appointment of a receiver.

Duties of bailiff as to goods taken in execution

89.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), where any goods of a limited liability partnership are taken in execution and, before the sale thereof or the completion of the execution by the receipt or recovery of the full amount of the levy, notice is served on the bailiff that a provisional liquidator has been appointed or that a winding up order has been made or that a resolution for voluntary winding up has been passed, the bailiff shall, on being so required, deliver the goods and any money seized or received in part satisfaction of the execution to the liquidator, but the costs of the execution shall be a first charge on the goods or moneys so delivered, and the liquidator may sell the goods, or a sufficient part thereof, for the purpose of satisfying that charge.

(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), where under an execution in respect of a judgment for a sum exceeding $100 the goods of a limited liability partnership are sold or money is paid in order to avoid sale, the bailiff shall deduct the costs of the execution from the proceeds of the sale or the money paid and retain the balance of 14 days; and if within that time notice is served on him of an application for the winding up of the limited liability partnership having been made or of a meeting having been called at which there is to be proposed a resolution for the voluntary winding up and an order is made or a resolution is passed for the winding up, the bailiff shall pay the balance to the liquidator who shall be entitled to retain it as against the execution creditor.

[42/2005]

(3) The rights conferred by this paragraph on the liquidator may be set aside by the Court in favour of the creditor to such extent and subject to such terms as the Court thinks fit.

94.—(1) If, in the course of the winding up of a limited liability partnership or in any proceedings against a limited liability partnership, it appears that any business of the limited liability partnership has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the limited liability partnership or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or partner of the limited liability partnership, may, if it thinks proper to do so, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the limited liability partnership as the Court directs.

(2) Where a person has been convicted of an offence under paragraph 93(3) in relation to the contracting of such a debt as is referred to in that sub-paragraph, the Court, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or partner of the limited liability partnership, may, if it thinks proper to do so, declare that the person shall be personally responsible without any limitation of liability for the payment of the whole or any part of that debt.

(3) Where the Court makes any declaration pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) or (2), it may give such further directions as it thinks proper for the purpose of giving effect to that declaration, and in particular may make provision for making the liability of any person under the declaration a charge on any debt or obligation due from the limited liability partnership to him, or on any charge or any interest in any charge on any assets of the limited liability partnership held by or vested in him or any corporation or person on his behalf, or any person claiming as assignee from or through the person liable or any corporation or person acting on his behalf, and may from time to time make such further order as is necessary for the purpose of enforcing any charge imposed under this sub-paragraph.

(4) In sub-paragraph (3), “assignee” includes any person to whom or in whose favour by the directions of the person liable the debt, obligation or charge was created, issued or transferred or the interest created, but does not include an assignee for valuable consideration (not including consideration by way of marriage) given in good faith and without notice of any of the matters on the ground of which the declaration is made.

(5) Where any business of a limited liability partnership is carried on with the intent or for the purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), every person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business with that intent or purpose shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $15,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.

(6) Sub-paragraph (5) shall apply to a limited liability partnership whether or not it has been, or is in the course of being, wound up.

(7) This paragraph shall have effect notwithstanding that the person concerned is criminally liable apart from this paragraph in respect of the matters on the ground of which the declaration is made.

(8) On the hearing of an application under sub-paragraph (1) or (2), the liquidator may himself give evidence or call witnesses.

Power of Court to assess damages against delinquent officers, etc.

95.—(1) If, in the course of winding up, it appears that any person who has taken part in the formation or registration of the limited liability partnership or any past or present liquidator or officer has misapplied or retained or become liable or accountable for any money or property of the limited liability partnership or been guilty of any misfeasance or breach of trust or duty in relation to the limited liability partnership, the Court may on the application of the liquidator or of any creditor or partner examine into the conduct of such person, liquidator or officer and compel him to repay or restore the money or property or any part thereof with interest at such rate as the Court thinks just, or to contribute such sum to the assets of the limited liability partnership by way of compensation in respect of the misapplication, retainer, misfeasance or breach of trust or duty as the Court thinks just.

(2) This paragraph shall extend and apply to and in respect of the receipt of any money or property by any officer of the limited liability partnership during the 2 years preceding the commencement of the winding up whether by way of salary or otherwise appearing to the Court to be unfair or unjust to other partners of the limited liability partnership.

(3) This paragraph shall have effect notwithstanding that the offence is one for which the offender is criminally liable.

Prosecution of delinquent officers and partners of limited liability partnership

96.—(1) If it appears to the Court, in the course of a winding up by the Court, that any past or present officer, or any partner, of the limited liability partnership has been guilty of an offence in relation to the limited liability partnership for which he is criminally liable, the Court may, either on the application of any person interested in the winding up or of its own motion, direct the liquidator to prosecute the offender or to refer the matter to the Minister.

(2) If it appears to the liquidator, in the course of a voluntary winding up, that any past or present officer, or any partner, of the limited liability partnership has been guilty of any offence in relation to the limited liability partnership for which he is criminally liable, he shall immediately report the matter to the Minister and shall, in respect of information or documents in his possession or under his control which relate to the matter in question, furnish the Minister with such information and give to him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of any document as he may require.

(3) If it appears to the liquidator, in the course of any winding up, that the limited liability partnership which is being wound up will be unable to pay its unsecured creditors more than 50 cents in the dollar, the liquidator shall immediately report the matter in writing to the Official Receiver and shall furnish the Official Receiver with such information and give to him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of any document as the Official Receiver may require.

(4) Where any report is made under sub-paragraph (2) or (3), the Minister may, if he thinks fit, investigate the matter and for the purposes of such an investigation shall have all such powers of investigating the affairs of the limited liability partnership as are provided by this Act in the case of a winding up by the Court, but if it appears to him that the case is not one in which proceedings ought to be taken by him he shall inform the liquidator accordingly, and thereupon, subject to the previous approval of the Court the liquidator may himself take proceedings against the offender.

(5) If it appears to the Court, in the course of a voluntary winding up, that any past or present officer, or any partner, of the limited liability partnership has been guilty as aforesaid and that no report with respect to the matter has been made by the liquidator to the Minister, the Court may, on the application of any person interested in the winding up or of its own motion, direct the liquidator to make such a report, and on a report being made accordingly this paragraph shall have effect as though the report has been made in pursuance of sub-paragraph (2).

(6) If, where any matter is reported or referred to the Minister or the Official Receiver under this paragraph, he considers that the case is one in which a prosecution ought to be instituted, he may institute proceedings accordingly, and the liquidator and every officer and agent of the limited liability partnership past and present, other than the defendant in the proceedings, shall give the Minister or the Official Receiver all assistance in connection with the prosecution which he is reasonably able to give.

(7) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (6), “agent”, in relation to a limited liability partnership, includes any banker or solicitor of the limited liability partnership and any person employed by the limited liability partnership as auditor, whether or not an officer of the limited liability partnership.

(8) If any person fails or neglects to give assistance in the manner required by sub-paragraph (6), the Court may, on the application of the Minister or the Official Receiver, direct that person to comply with the requirements of that sub-paragraph, and where any application is made under this sub-paragraph with respect to a liquidator the Court may, unless it appears that the failure or neglect to comply was due to the liquidator not having in his hands sufficient assets of the limited liability partnership to enable him to do so, direct that the costs of the application shall be borne by the liquidator personally.

(9) The Minister may direct that the whole or any part of any costs and expenses properly incurred by the liquidator in proceedings brought under this paragraph shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament.

(10) Subject to any direction given under sub-paragraph (9) and to any charges on the assets of the limited liability partnership and any debts to which priority is given by this Act, all such costs and expenses shall be payable out of those assets as part of the costs of winding up.

99.—(1) Where, after a limited liability partnership has been dissolved, there remains any outstanding property, movable or immovable, including things in action and whether in or outside Singapore which was vested in the limited liability partnership or to which it was entitled, or over which it had a disposing power at the time it was so dissolved, but which was not got in, realised upon or otherwise disposed of or dealt with by the limited liability partnership or its liquidator, such property, shall, for the purposes of the following paragraphs of this Division and notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to the contrary, by the operation of this paragraph, be and become vested in the Official Receiver for all the estate and interest therein legal or equitable of the limited liability partnership or its liquidator at the date the limited liability partnership was dissolved, together with all claims, rights and remedies which the limited liability partnership or its liquidator then had in respect thereof.

(2) Where any claim, right or remedy of the liquidator may under this Act be made, exercised or availed of only with the approval or concurrence of the Court or some other person, the Official Receiver may for the purposes of this paragraph make, exercise or avail himself of that claim, right or remedy without such approval or concurrence.

Disposal of outstanding interests in property

100.—(1) Upon proof to the satisfaction of the Official Receiver that there is vested in him by operation of paragraph 99 or by operation of any corresponding previous written law any estate or interest in property, whether solely or together with any other person, of a beneficial nature and not merely held in trust, the Official Receiver may sell or otherwise dispose of or deal with such estate or interest or any part thereof as he sees fit.

(2) The Official Receiver may sell or otherwise dispose of or deal with such property either solely or in concurrence with any other person in such manner for such consideration by public auction, public tender or private contract upon such terms and conditions as he thinks fit, with power to rescind any contract and resell or otherwise dispose of or deal with such property as he thinks expedient, and may make, execute, sign and give such contracts, instruments and documents as he thinks necessary.

(4) The moneys received by the Official Receiver in the exercise of any of the powers conferred on him by this Division shall be applied in defraying all costs, expenses, commission and fees incidental thereto and thereafter to any payment authorised by this Division and the surplus, if any, shall be dealt with as if they were unclaimed moneys paid to the Official Receiver in pursuance of paragraph 69.

Liability of Official Receiver and Government as to property vested in Official Receiver
