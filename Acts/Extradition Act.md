2\.—(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —

“declared Commonwealth country” means a country declared to be a Commonwealth country in relation to which Part IV applies;

“extradition crime”, in relation to a declared Commonwealth country, means an offence against the law of, or of a part of, a declared Commonwealth country —

(a) the maximum penalty for which is death or imprisonment for not less than 12 months; and

(b) the act or omission constituting the offence or the equivalent act or omission would, if it took place in or within the jurisdiction of Singapore, constitute an offence against the law in force in Singapore that —

(i) is described in the First Schedule; or

(ii) would be so described if the description concerned contained a reference to any intent or state of mind on the part of the person committing the offence, or to any circumstance of aggravation, necessary to constitute the offence;

“extradition crime”, in relation to a foreign State, means an offence against the law of, or of a part of, a foreign State and the act or omission constituting the offence or the equivalent act or omission would, if it took place in or within the jurisdiction of Singapore, constitute an offence against the law in force in Singapore that —

(a) is described in the First Schedule; or

(b) would be so described if the description concerned contained a reference to any intent or state of mind on the part of the person committing the offence, or to any circumstance of aggravation, necessary to constitute the offence;

“extradition treaty” means a treaty or agreement made by Singapore with a foreign State relating to the extradition of fugitives, and includes any treaty or agreement relating to the extradition of fugitives made before 9th August 1965 which extends to, and is binding on, Singapore;

“foreign State” means a foreign State between which and Singapore an extradition treaty is in force;

“foreign warrant” means a judicial or other document issued under the law of, or of a part of, a foreign State and authorising the apprehension of a person;

“fugitive” means a person who is accused of an extradition crime that is alleged to have been committed, or convicted of an extradition crime that was committed at a place within the jurisdiction of a declared Commonwealth country or a foreign State or of a part of such country or State and is, or is suspected to be, in Singapore;

“overseas warrant” means a judicial or other document issued under the law of, or of a part of, a declared Commonwealth country and authorising the apprehension of a person;

“prison” includes a gaol, lock-up or other place of detention.

(2) A reference in this Act to a fugitive from a foreign State or declared Commonwealth country shall be read as a reference to a fugitive accused of an extradition crime that is alleged to have been committed, or convicted of an extradition crime that was committed, at a place in that foreign State or declared Commonwealth country or within the jurisdiction of, or of a part of, that State or country.

(3) For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be deemed not to have been convicted of an offence against the law of, or of a part of, a foreign State or declared Commonwealth country where the conviction is, under that law, a conviction for contumacy, but a person so convicted for contumacy shall be deemed to be accused of an offence against that law.

(4) For the purposes of this Act, an offence against the law of a foreign State or declared Commonwealth country may be regarded as being an offence of a political character notwithstanding that there are not competing political parties in that State or country.

(5) For the purposes of this Act —

(a) a colony, territory or protectorate of a foreign State or of a country other than Singapore;

(b) a territory for the international relations of which a foreign State or a country other than Singapore is responsible; and

(7) Without prejudice to any powers or jurisdiction conferred upon a District Judge by the Criminal Procedure Code, a District Judge shall in the exercise of his jurisdiction have all the powers that are conferred upon and exercised by a Magistrate under this Act; and accordingly every reference to a Magistrate in this Act shall be read as including a reference to a District Judge.

### Application of Part in relation to foreign States to which Extradition Acts 1870 to 1935 applied

3\.—(1) Where, immediately before the commencement of this Act —

(a) under an Order in Council in force under the Imperial Acts known as the Extradition Acts 1870 to 1935, those Acts applied in the case of a foreign State specified in the Order; and

(b) those Acts, as they so applied, extended to Singapore,

this Part applies in relation to that State.

(2) If the operation of the Order was subject to any limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications, then, subject to this section and sections 4 and 5, this Part applies in relation to that State subject to those limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications.

(3) The Minister may by notification in theGazettedirect that this Part ceases to apply in relation to a foreign State specified in the notification, being a foreign State in relation to which this Act applied by virtue of subsection (1), and, upon the coming into operation of a notification that so provides, this Part ceases to apply in relation to that State.

(4) The coming into operation of a notification made for the purposes of subsection (3) in relation to a foreign State does not prevent this Part from again applying in relation to that State by virtue of a notification made for the purposes of section 4.

### Part may be applied in relation to foreign State byGazettenotification

4\.—(1) Where, after the commencement of this Act, an extradition treaty (including an extradition treaty that affects or amends an earlier extradition treaty) comes into force between Singapore and a foreign State —

(a) if this Part applies in relation to the foreign State at the time of the coming into force of that treaty — the Minister may by notification in theGazettedirect that this Part applies in relation to that State after that time subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary or desirable to give effect to that treaty and are specified in the notification; or

(b) if this Part does not apply in relation to the foreign State at the time of the coming into force of that treaty — the Minister may by notification in theGazettedirect that this Part applies in relation to that State after that time and may also provide that it so applies subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary or desirable to give effect to that treaty and are specified in the notification.

(2) The limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications referred to in subsection (1) may, in relation to a foreign State, be expressed in the form that this Part applies in relation to that State subject to the extradition treaty referred to in that subsection.

### Effect of applying Part in relation to foreign State byGazettenotification

5\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2) where the notification for the time being in force provides that this Part applies in relation to a foreign State, this Part applies in relation to that State.

(2) Where the notification for the time being in force provides that this Part applies in relation to a foreign State subject to any limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications, this Part applies in relation to that State subject to those limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications.

### Liability of fugitive to be surrendered

6\. Where this Part applies in relation to a foreign State, every fugitive from that State shall be liable, subject to this Part and to any limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications to which the application of this Part in relation to that State is subject, to be apprehended and surrendered to that State as provided by this Part and shall be so liable whether the offence to which the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive relates is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before or after the date of the coming into operation of this Part or before or after the date when this Part commenced to apply in relation to that State.

### Restrictions on surrender of persons to foreign States

7\.—(1) A person shall not be liable to be surrendered to a foreign State if the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates is, or is by reason of the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been committed or was committed, an offence of a political character.

(2) A person shall not be liable to be surrendered to a foreign State unless provision is made by a law of that State, or by an extradition treaty in force between Singapore and that State, by virtue of which the person shall not, unless he has been returned, or has had an opportunity of returning, to Singapore —

(a) be detained or tried in that foreign State for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before his surrender other than the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates or any other offence of which he could be convicted upon proof of the facts on which that requisition was based; or

(b) be detained in that foreign State for the purpose of his being surrendered to another country for trial or punishment for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before his surrender to that foreign State other than an offence of which he could be convicted upon proof of the facts on which the requisition referred to in paragraph (a) was based.

(3) A person who is held in custody, or has been admitted to bail, in Singapore in respect of an offence that is alleged to have been committed in Singapore, or is undergoing a sentence for a conviction in Singapore, shall not be liable to be surrendered to a foreign State until he has been discharged from custody, or the recognizances upon which he was admitted to bail have been discharged, as the case may be, whether as a result of his acquittal, on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.

(4) A person shall not be liable to be surrendered to a foreign State in respect of an offence if he has been acquitted or pardoned by a competent tribunal or authority in any country, or has undergone the punishment provided by the law of, or of a part of, any country, in respect of that offence or of another offence constituted by the same act or omission as that offence.

### Restriction on power of Minister to authorise the apprehension, or order the surrender, of a fugitive

8\. The Minister shall not give a notice under section 9(1), or issue a warrant under section 12(2), in respect of a fugitive from a foreign State, if the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that —

(a) the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive, although purporting to have been made in respect of an offence for which, but for this section, he would be liable to be surrendered to that State, was made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions; or

(b) if the fugitive is surrendered to that State, he may be prejudiced at his trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty, by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions.

### Notice by Minister

9\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), where a requisition for the surrender of a fugitive who is, or is suspected of being, in Singapore is made to the Minister by a foreign State, the Minister may, in his discretion —

(a) if a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive has not been issued under section 10, by notice in writing in accordance with Form 1 in the Second Schedule and directed to a Magistrate, inform the Magistrate that the requisition has been made and authorise him to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive; or

(b) if a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive has been issued under section 10 and a person has been apprehended under the warrant, by notice in writing in accordance with Form 2 in the Second Schedule and directed to a Magistrate before whom the person may be brought, inform the Magistrate that the requisition has been made.

(2) If the Minister is of the opinion that the fugitive is not liable to be surrendered to the foreign State, he shall not give a notice under subsection (1) in respect of the fugitive.

### Issue of warrants

10\.—(1) Where —

(a) a Magistrate is authorised by the Minister by a notice under section 9(1)(a) to issue a warrant for the apprehension of a fugitive; or

(b) an application is made as prescribed to a Magistrate for the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of a fugitive who is, or is suspected of being, in Singapore,

and there is produced to the Magistrate such evidence as would, in his opinion, according to the law in force in Singapore, justify —

(i) the apprehension of the fugitive by a member of the Singapore Police Force without the issue of a warrant; or

(ii) the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive,

if the act or omission constituting the extradition crime had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore, the Magistrate shall issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive in accordance with Form 3 or 4, as the case may be, in the Second Schedule.

(2) Where a Magistrate issues a warrant under this section without having been authorised by the Minister by a notice under section 9(1)(a) to issue the warrant, the Magistrate shall forthwith send to the Minister a report stating that he has issued the warrant and the evidence produced to him on the application for the warrant.

(3) It shall be a sufficient compliance with subsection (2) in relation to any evidence consisting of testimony given on oath, or declared or affirmed to be true, by a person if —

(a) where the testimony was given in writing — the Magistrate sends to the Minister a copy of that writing certified by him to be a true copy; or

(b) where the testimony was given orally —

(i) if the testimony has been reduced to writing — the Magistrate sends to the Minister that writing certified by him to be a true record of the testimony; or

(ii) if the testimony has not been reduced to writing — the Magistrate sends to the Minister the notes made by the Magistrate in respect of the testimony and certified by him to be a true summary of the testimony.

(4) Where the Minister —

(a) receives a report of the issue of a warrant and the evidence as provided by subsections (2) and (3); or

(b) otherwise becomes aware of the issue of such a warrant,

he may, if he thinks fit, by order in writing, direct that the warrant be cancelled.

(5) Where a person has been apprehended under a warrant that is so directed to be cancelled —

(a) if the person is held in custody, the person holding him in custody shall, upon receipt of the order, cause him to be released; or

(b) if he has been admitted to bail, the recognizances upon which he was admitted to bail are, by force of this subsection, discharged.

### Proceedings after apprehension of person

11\.—(1) A person who is apprehended under a warrant issued in pursuance of section 10 shall, unless he is sooner released, be brought as soon as practicable before a Magistrate.

(2) The Magistrate may remand a person brought before him under this section, either in custody or on bail, for a period or periods not exceeding 7 days at any one time and, where a Magistrate remands a person for such a period, the person may, at the expiration of the period, be brought before that Magistrate or before any other Magistrate.

(3) In the application of subsections (4) to (8) in relation to a person who has been apprehended under a warrant issued in pursuance of section 10, “Magistrate” means the Magistrate before whom the person is brought after he was apprehended or at the expiration of a period for which he has been remanded under this section, as the case may be.

(4) If the person was apprehended under a warrant issued otherwise than in pursuance of an authority by the Minister in a notice under section 9(1)(a), the Magistrate shall remand the person in accordance with subsection (2) until the Magistrate receives a notice under section 9(1)(b) from the Minister informing the Magistrate that a requisition for the surrender of the person has been made to the Minister by a foreign State.

(5) Where the Magistrate does not receive such a notice within such time as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, the Magistrate shall —

(a) if the person apprehended is held in custody — order that he be released; or

(b) if he has been admitted to bail — make an order discharging the recognizances upon which he was admitted to bail.

(6) If the person was apprehended under a warrant issued in pursuance of an authority by the Minister in a notice under section 9(1)(a) or the Magistrate receives a notice from the Minister under section 9(1)(b) and —

(a) there is produced to the Magistrate a duly authenticated foreign warrant in respect of the person issued in the foreign State that made the requisition for the surrender of the person;

(b) there is produced to the Magistrate —

(i) in the case of a person who is accused of an extradition crime — such evidence as would, in the opinion of the Magistrate, according to the law in force in Singapore, justify the trial of the person if the act or omission constituting that crime had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore; or

(ii) in the case of a person who is alleged to have been convicted of an extradition crime — sufficient evidence to satisfy the Magistrate that the person has been convicted of that crime; and

(c) the Magistrate is satisfied, after hearing any evidence tendered by the person, that the person is liable to be surrendered to the foreign State that made the requisition for the surrender,

the Magistrate shall, by warrant in accordance with Form 5 in the Second Schedule, commit the person to prison to await the warrant of the Minister for his surrender but otherwise shall order that the person be released.

(7) Where the Magistrate is of the opinion that it would be dangerous to the life or prejudicial to the health of the person to commit him to prison, he may, in lieu of committing him to prison, by warrant, order that he be held in custody at the place where he is for the time being, or at any other place to which the Magistrate considers that he can be removed without danger to his life or prejudice to his health, until such time as he can without such danger or prejudice be committed to prison or he is surrendered and, in such a case, the warrant shall be in accordance with Form 5 in the Second Schedule with such variations as are necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.

(8) Where, in pursuance of this section, a Magistrate commits a person to prison or otherwise orders that he be held in custody, he shall forthwith send to the Minister a certificate to that effect and such report (if any) relating to the proceedings as he thinks fit.

### Surrender of fugitive to foreign State

12\.—(1) When, in pursuance of this Part, a Magistrate commits a person (referred to in this section as the prisoner) to prison, or otherwise orders that he be held in custody, to await the warrant of the Minister for his surrender to a foreign State, the Magistrate shall inform the prisoner that he will not be surrendered until after the expiration of the period of 15 days from the date of the committal or order and that, if he asserts that his detention is unlawful, he may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a writ of habeas corpus.

(2) After —

(a) the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (1); or

(b) if, within that period, an application for a writ of habeas corpus is made by the prisoner and the court to which the application is made or, where an appeal is brought from the decision of that court to another court, the other court does not order that the prisoner be released — the expiration of the period of 15 days from the date of the decision of the first-mentioned court or the appellate court, as the case may be,

whichever is the later, the Minister may, in his discretion, if he is satisfied that the prisoner is liable to be surrendered to the foreign State, by warrant in accordance with Form 6 in the Second Schedule or, where the prisoner is held in custody otherwise than at a prison, in accordance with that Form with such variations as are necessary to meet the circumstances of the case, order that the prisoner be delivered into the custody of a person specified in the warrant and be conveyed by that person to a place in the foreign State or within the jurisdiction of, or of a part of, the foreign State and there surrendered to some person appointed by the foreign State to receive him.

(3) A warrant issued in pursuance of subsection (2) may be executed according to its tenor.

(4) If the prisoner escapes from the custody of the person executing the warrant, he may be retaken in the same manner as a person accused of an offence against the law in force in Singapore may be taken upon an escape from lawful custody.

(5) Any property in the possession of the prisoner at the time of his apprehension that may be material as evidence in proving the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates shall, if the Minister so directs, be delivered up with the prisoner on his surrender.

### Discharge of fugitive who is not conveyed out of Singapore within two months

13\. Where a person who, in pursuance of this Part, has been committed to prison, or otherwise ordered to be held in custody, is in custody in Singapore at the expiration of two months after —

(a) the date of the committal or order; or

(b) if an application for a writ of habeas corpus has been made by the person — the date of the decision of the court to which the application was made or, where an appeal has been brought from that decision to another court, the date of the decision of the other court,

whichever is the later, the High Court, upon application made to it by the person and upon proof that reasonable notice of the intention to make the application has been given to the Minister, shall, unless reasonable cause is shown for the delay, order that the person be released.

## PART III

EXTRADITION FROM FOREIGN STATES

### Interpretation

14\. In this Part, “extraditable crime” means an offence (wherever committed) against the law in force in Singapore, being an offence that —

(a) is described in the First Schedule; or

(b) would be so described if the description concerned contained a reference to any intent or state of mind on the part of the person committing the offence, or to any circumstance of aggravation, necessary to constitute the offence.

### Requisition to foreign State for surrender of persons to be made by Minister

15\. Where a person accused or convicted of an extraditable crime is, or is suspected of being, in a foreign State or within the jurisdiction of, or of a part of, a foreign State, the Minister may make a requisition to that State for the surrender of the person.

### Person surrendered may be brought into Singapore

16\. Where a person accused or convicted of an extraditable crime is surrendered by a foreign State, the person may be brought into Singapore and delivered to the proper authorities to be dealt with according to law.

### Person surrendered by foreign State in respect of an offence not to be prosecuted or detained for other offences

17\. Where a person accused or convicted of an extraditable crime is surrendered by a foreign State, the person shall not, unless he has been returned, or has had an opportunity of returning, to that foreign State —

(a) be detained or tried in Singapore for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before his surrender other than the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates or any other offence of which he could be convicted upon proof of the facts on which that requisition was based; or

(b) be detained in Singapore for the purpose of his being surrendered to another country for trial or punishment for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before his surrender to Singapore other than an offence of which he could be convicted upon proof of the facts on which the requisition referred to in paragraph (a) was based.

## PART IV

EXTRADITION TO AND FROM DECLARED COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES

### Application of Part in relation to Commonwealth countries

18\.—(1) The Minister may declare a country to be a Commonwealth country in relation to which this Part applies and, subject to subsection (2), where there is such a declaration for the time being in force, this Part shall apply in relation to that country.

(2) The Minister may provide that this Part shall apply in relation to a declared Commonwealth country subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are prescribed and, where the declaration for the time being in force so provides, this Part shall apply in relation to that country subject to those limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications.

### Liability of fugitive to be surrendered

19\. Every fugitive from a declared Commonwealth country shall be liable, subject to this Part and to any limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications to which the application of this Part in relation to that country is subject, to be apprehended and surrendered to that country as provided by this Part and shall be so liable whether the offence to which the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive relates is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before or after the commencement of this Act or before or after the time when that country became a declared Commonwealth country.

### Restrictions on surrender of persons to Commonwealth countries

20\.—(1) A person shall not be liable to be surrendered to a declared Commonwealth country if the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates is, or is by reason of the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been committed or was committed, an offence of a political character.

(2) A person who is held in custody, or has been admitted to bail, in Singapore in respect of an offence that is alleged to have been committed in Singapore, or is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for a conviction in Singapore, shall not be liable to be surrendered to a declared Commonwealth country until he has been discharged from custody, or the recognizances upon which he was admitted to bail have been discharged, as the case may be, whether as a result of his acquittal, on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.

(3) A person shall not be liable to be surrendered to a declared Commonwealth country in respect of an offence if he has been acquitted or pardoned by a competent tribunal or authority in any country, or has undergone the punishment provided by the law of, or of a part of, any country, in respect of that offence or of another offence constituted by the same act or omission as that offence.

### Restrictions on power of Minister to authorise the apprehension, or order the surrender, of a fugitive

21\.—(1) The Minister shall not give a notice under section 22(1), or issue a warrant under section 26(2), in respect of a fugitive from a declared Commonwealth country if the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that —

(a) the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive, although purporting to have been made in respect of an offence for which, but for this section, he would be liable to be surrendered to that country, was made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions; or

(b) if the fugitive is surrendered to that country, he may be prejudiced at his trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty, by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions.

(2) If the Minister is satisfied that, by reason of —

(a) the trivial nature of the offence that a fugitive is alleged to have committed or has committed;

(b) the accusation against a fugitive not having been made in good faith or in the interests of justice; or

(c) the passage of time since the offence is alleged to have been committed or was committed,
