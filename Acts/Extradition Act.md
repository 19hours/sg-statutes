“extradition crime”, in relation to a foreign State, means an offence against the law of, or of a part of, a foreign State and the act or omission constituting the offence or the equivalent act or omission would, if it took place in or within the jurisdiction of Singapore, constitute an offence against the law in force in Singapore that —

(3) For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be deemed not to have been convicted of an offence against the law of, or of a part of, a foreign State or declared Commonwealth country where the conviction is, under that law, a conviction for contumacy, but a person so convicted for contumacy shall be deemed to be accused of an offence against that law.

(2) Every such fugitive shall be liable under subsection (1) whether the offence to which the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive relates is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before or after the date of the coming into operation of this Part or before or after the date when this Part commenced to apply in relation to that State.

### Restrictions on surrender of persons to foreign States

7\.—(1) A person shall not be liable to be surrendered to a foreign State if the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates is, or is by reason of the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been committed or was committed, an offence of a political character.

(a) be detained or tried in that foreign State for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before his surrender other than the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates or any other offence of which he could be convicted upon proof of the facts on which that requisition was based; or

(i) the apprehension of the fugitive by a member of the Singapore Police Force without the issue of a warrant; or

(ii) the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive,

if the act or omission constituting the extradition crime had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore, the Magistrate shall issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive in accordance with Form 3 or 4, as the case may be, in the Second Schedule.

(a) there is produced to the Magistrate a duly authenticated foreign warrant in respect of the person issued in the foreign State that made the requisition for the surrender of the person;

(b) there is produced to the Magistrate —

(i) in the case of a person who is accused of an extradition crime — such evidence as would, in the opinion of the Magistrate, according to the law in force in Singapore, justify the trial of the person if the act or omission constituting that crime had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore; or

(ii) in the case of a person who is alleged to have been convicted of an extradition crime — sufficient evidence to satisfy the Magistrate that the person has been convicted of that crime; and

(c) the Magistrate is satisfied, after hearing any evidence tendered by the person, that the person is liable to be surrendered to the foreign State that made the requisition for the surrender,

the Magistrate shall, by warrant in accordance with Form 5 in the Second Schedule, commit the person to prison to await the warrant of the Minister for his surrender but otherwise shall order that the person be released.

(8) Where the Magistrate is of the opinion that it would be dangerous to the life or prejudicial to the health of the person to commit him to prison, he may, in lieu of committing him to prison, by warrant, order that he be held in custody at the place where he is for the time being, or at any other place to which the Magistrate considers that he can be removed without danger to his life or prejudice to his health, until such time as he can without such danger or prejudice be committed to prison or he is surrendered.

(9) In the case referred to in subsection (8), the warrant shall be in accordance with Form 5 in the Second Schedule with such variations as are necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.

(10) Where, under this section, a Magistrate commits a person to prison or otherwise orders that he be held in custody, he shall forthwith send to the Minister a certificate to that effect and such report (if any) relating to the proceedings as he thinks fit.

### Surrender of fugitive to foreign State

12\.—(1) When, under this Part, a Magistrate commits a person (referred to in this section as the prisoner) to prison, or otherwise orders that he be held in custody, to await the warrant of the Minister for his surrender to a foreign State, the Magistrate shall inform the prisoner that he will not be surrendered until after the expiration of the period of 15 days from the date of the committal or order and that, if he asserts that his detention is unlawful, he may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an Order for Review of Detention.

[42/2005 wef 01/01/2006]

(2) After —

(a) the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (1); or

(b) if, within that period, an application for an Order for Review of Detention is made by the prisoner and the court to which the application is made or, where an appeal is brought from the decision of that court to another court, the other court does not order that the prisoner be released — the expiration of the period of 15 days from the date of the decision of the first-mentioned court or the appellate court, as the case may be,

whichever is the later, the Minister may, in his discretion, if he is satisfied that the prisoner is liable to be surrendered to the foreign State, by warrant in accordance with Form 6 in the Second Schedule or, where the prisoner is held in custody otherwise than at a prison, in accordance with that Form with such variations as are necessary to meet the circumstances of the case, order that the prisoner be delivered into the custody of a person specified in the warrant and be conveyed by that person to a place in the foreign State or within the jurisdiction of, or of a part of, the foreign State and there surrendered to some person appointed by the foreign State to receive him.

[42/2005 wef 01/01/2006]

(3) A warrant issued under subsection (2) may be executed according to its tenor.

(4) If the prisoner escapes from the custody of the person executing the warrant, he may be retaken in the same manner as a person accused of an offence against the law in force in Singapore may be taken upon an escape from lawful custody.

(5) Any property in the possession of the prisoner at the time of his apprehension that may be material as evidence in proving the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates shall, if the Minister so directs, be delivered up with the prisoner on his surrender.

(a) the date of the committal or order; or

(b) if an application for an Order for Review of Detention has been made by the person — the date of the decision of the court to which the application was made or, where an appeal has been brought from that decision to another court, the date of the decision of the other court,

whichever is the later, the High Court, upon application made to it by the person and upon proof that reasonable notice of the intention to make the application has been given to the Minister, shall, unless reasonable cause is shown for the delay, order that the person be released.

(a) the trivial nature of the offence that a fugitive is alleged to have committed or has committed;

(b) the accusation against a fugitive not having been made in good faith or in the interests of justice; or

(c) the passage of time since the offence is alleged to have been committed or was committed,

(a) be detained or tried in that country for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before his surrender other than —

(i) the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates or any lesser offence of which he could be convicted upon proof of the facts on which that requisition was based; or

(ii) any other extradition crime in respect of which the Minister consents to his being so detained or tried, as the case may be; or

(b) be detained in that country for the purpose of his being surrendered to another country for trial or punishment for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before his surrender to the first-mentioned country other than —

(i) a lesser offence of which he could be convicted upon proof of the facts on which the requisition referred to in paragraph (a) was based; or
