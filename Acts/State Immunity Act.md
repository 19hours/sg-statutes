Immunity from jurisdiction

### General immunity from jurisdiction

Exceptions from immunity

### Submission to jurisdiction

4\.—(1) A State is not immune as respects proceedings in respect of which it has submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore.

(2) A State may submit after the dispute giving rise to the proceedings has arisen or by a prior written agreement; but a provision in any agreement that it is to be governed by the law of Singapore is not to be regarded as a submission.

(3) A State is deemed to have submitted —

(a) if it has instituted the proceedings; or

(b) subject to subsections (4) and (5), if it has intervened or taken any step in the proceedings.

(4) Subsection (3)(b) does not apply to intervention or any step taken for the purpose only of —

(a) claiming immunity; or

(b) asserting an interest in property in circumstances such that the State would have been entitled to immunity if the proceedings had been brought against it.

(5) Subsection (3)(b) does not apply to any step taken by the State in ignorance of facts entitling it to immunity if those facts could not reasonably have been ascertained and immunity is claimed as soon as reasonably practicable.

(6) A submission in respect of any proceedings extends to any appeal but not to any counter-claim unless it arises out of the same legal relationship or facts as the claim.

(7) The head of a State’s diplomatic mission in Singapore, or the person for the time being performing his functions, shall be deemed to have authority to submit on behalf of the State in respect of any proceedings; and any person who has entered into a contract on behalf of and with the authority of a State shall be deemed to have authority to submit on its behalf in respect of proceedings arising out of the contract.

5\.—(1) A State is not immune as respects proceedings relating to —

(a) a commercial transaction entered into by the State; or

(b) an obligation of the State which by virtue of a contract (whether a commercial transaction or not) falls to be performed wholly or partly in Singapore,

but this subsection does not apply to a contract of employment between a State and an individual.

(2) This section does not apply if the parties to the dispute are States or have otherwise agreed in writing; and subsection (1)(b) does not apply if the contract (not being a commercial transaction) was made in the territory of the State concerned and the obligation in question is governed by its administrative law.

(3) In this section “commercial transaction” means —

(a) any contract for the supply of goods or services;

(b) any loan or other transaction for the provision of finance and any guarantee or indemnity in respect of any such transaction or of any other financial obligation; and

(c) any other transaction or activity (whether of a commercial, industrial, financial, professional or other similar character) into which a State enters or in which it engages otherwise than in the exercise of sovereign authority.

### Contracts of employment

6\.—(1) A State is not immune as respects proceedings relating to a contract of employment between the State and an individual where the contract was made in Singapore or the work is to be wholly or partly performed in Singapore.

(c) the parties to the contract have otherwise agreed in writing.

(3) Where the work is for an office, agency or establishment maintained by the State in Singapore for commercial purposes, subsection (2)(a) and (b) does not exclude the application of this section unless the individual was, at the time when the contract was made, habitually resident in that State.

(4) Subsection (2)(c) does not exclude the application of this section where the law of Singapore requires the proceedings to be brought before a court in Singapore.

(5) In this section, “proceedings relating to a contract of employment” includes proceedings between the parties to such a contract in respect of any statutory rights or duties to which they are entitled or subject as employer or employee.

(b) any obligation of the State arising out of its interest in, or its possession or use of, any such property.

(2) A State is not immune as respects proceedings relating to any interest of the State in movable or immovable property, being an interest arising by way of succession, gift or bona vacantia.

(3) The fact that a State has or claims an interest in any property shall not preclude any court from exercising in respect of it any jurisdiction relating to the estates of deceased persons or persons of unsound mind or to insolvency, the winding up of companies or the administration of trusts.

(4) A court may entertain proceedings against a person other than a State notwithstanding that the proceedings relate to property —

(a) which is in the possession or control of a State; or

(a) has members other than States; and

(b) is incorporated or constituted under the law of Singapore or is controlled from or has its principal place of business in Singapore,

being proceedings arising between the State and the body or its other members or, as the case may be, between the State and the other partners.

if, at the time when the cause of action arose, the ship was in use or intended for use for commercial purposes.

(3) Where an action in rem is brought against a ship belonging to a State for enforcing a claim in connection with another ship belonging to that State, subsection (2)(a) does not apply as respects the first-mentioned ship unless, at the time when the cause of action relating to the other ship arose, both ships were in use or intended for use for commercial purposes.

Procedure

### Service of process and judgments in default of appearance

14\.—(1) Any writ or other document required to be served for instituting proceedings against a State shall be served by being transmitted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore, to the ministry of foreign affairs of the State and service shall be deemed to have been effected when the writ or document is received at that ministry.

(2) Any time for entering an appearance (whether prescribed by Rules of Court or otherwise) shall begin to run two months after the date on which the writ or document is received as aforesaid.

(3) A State which appears in proceedings cannot thereafter object that subsection (1) has not been complied with in the case of those proceedings.

(4) No judgment in default of appearance shall be given against a State except on proof that subsection (1) has been complied with and that the time for entering an appearance as extended by subsection (2) has expired.

(5) A copy of any judgment given against a State in default of appearance shall be transmitted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore, to the ministry of foreign affairs of that State and any time for applying to have the judgment set aside (whether prescribed by Rules of Court or otherwise) shall begin to run two months after the date on which the copy of the judgment is received at that ministry.

(6) Subsection (1) does not prevent the service of a writ or other document in any manner to which the State has agreed and subsections (2) and (4) do not apply where service is effected in any such manner.

(7) This section shall not be construed as applying to proceedings against a State by way of counter-claim or to an action in rem; and subsection (1) shall not be construed as affecting any Rules of Court whereby leave is required for the service of process outside the jurisdiction.

### Other procedural privileges

15\.—(1) No penalty by way of committal or fine shall be imposed in respect of any failure or refusal by or on behalf of a State to disclose or produce any document or other information for the purposes of proceedings to which it is a party.

(a) relief shall not be given against a State by way of injunction or order for specific performance or for the recovery of land or other property; and

(3) Subsection (2) does not prevent the giving of any relief or the issue of any process with the written consent of the State concerned; and any such consent (which may be contained in a prior agreement) may be expressed so as to apply to a limited extent or generally; but a provision merely submitting to the jurisdiction of the courts is not to be regarded as a consent for the purposes of this subsection.

(4) Subsection (2)(b) does not prevent the issue of any process in respect of property which is for the time being in use or intended for use for commercial purposes.

(5) The head of a State’s diplomatic mission in Singapore, or the person for the time being performing his functions, shall be deemed to have authority to give on behalf of the State any such consent as is mentioned in subsection (3) and, for the purposes of subsection (4), his certificate to the effect that any property is not in use or intended for use by or on behalf of the State for commercial purposes shall be accepted as sufficient evidence of that fact unless the contrary is proved.

but not to any entity (referred to in this section as a separate entity) which is distinct from the executive organs of the government of the State and capable of suing or being sued.

(4) Property of a State’s central bank or other monetary authority shall not be regarded for the purposes of section 15(4) as in use or intended for use for commercial purposes; and where any such bank or authority is a separate entity section 15(1) to (3) shall apply to it as if references to a State were references to the bank or authority.

(5) Section 14 applies to proceedings against the constituent territories of a federal State; and the President may by order provide for the other provisions of this Part to apply to any such constituent territory specified in the order as they apply to a State.

(6) Where the provisions of Part II do not apply to a constituent territory by virtue of any such order subsections (2) and (3) shall apply to it as if it were a separate entity.

### Restriction and extension of immunities and privileges

17\. If it appears to the President that the immunities and privileges conferred by Part II in relation to any State —

(a) exceed those accorded by the law of that State in relation to Singapore; or

(b) are less than those required by any treaty, convention or other international agreement to which that State and Singapore are parties,

the President may, by order, provide for restricting or, as the case may be, extending those immunities and privileges to such extent as appears to the President to be appropriate.

### Evidence by certificate

18\. A certificate by or on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be conclusive evidence on any question —

(b) whether, and if so when, a document has been served or received as mentioned in section 14(1) or (5).
