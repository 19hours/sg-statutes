## PART II

PIONEER INDUSTRIES

### Power and procedure for declaring an industry and a product a pioneer industry and a pioneer product

4\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Minister may, if he considers it expedient in the public interest to do so, by order declare an industry, which is not being carried on in Singapore on a scale adequate to the economic needs of Singapore and for which in his opinion there are favourable prospects for development, to be a pioneer industry and any specific product of that industry to be a pioneer product.

(2) Before making any order under subsection (1), the Minister shall —

(a) cause a notice to be published in theGazettesetting out the order which it is proposed to make and inviting any person who may object to the making of the order to give notice in writing of his objection and the grounds thereof to the Minister on or before such date (not being a date less than 30 days from the date of publication of the notice) as may be specified in the notice; and

(b) consider any objection which has been received pursuant to the notice.

(3) The Minister may, if he considers it necessary, call for further particulars of the grounds of any such objection from any person who has given due notice of the objection.

(4) The Minister may revoke any order made under this section but any such revocation shall not affect the operation of any pioneer certificate issued to any pioneer enterprise before the revocation.

### Application for and issue and amendment of pioneer certificate

5\.—(1) Any company which is desirous of producing a pioneer product may make an application in writing to the Minister to be approved as a pioneer enterprise in such form and with such particulars as may be prescribed.

(2) Where the Minister is satisfied that it is expedient in the public interest to do so and, in particular, having regard to the production or anticipated production of the pioneer product from all sources of production in Singapore, he may approve that company as a pioneer enterprise and issue a pioneer certificate to the company, subject to such conditions as he thinks fit.

(3) Every pioneer certificate issued under this section shall specify —

(a) the date on or before which it is expected that the pioneer enterprise will commence to produce in marketable quantities the product specified in the certificate; and

(b) the rate of production of that product which it is expected will be attained on or before that date.

(4) The date specified under subsection (3)(a) shall be deemed to be the production day of the pioneer enterprise for the purposes of this Act.

(5) The Minister may, in his discretion, upon the application of any pioneer enterprise, amend its pioneer certificate by substituting for the production day specified therein such earlier or later date as he thinks fit and thereupon the provisions of this Act shall have effect as if the date so substituted were the production day in relation to that pioneer enterprise.

### Tax relief period of pioneer enterprise

6\. The tax relief period of a pioneer enterprise shall commence on its production day and shall continue for such period, not exceeding 10 years, as the Minister may determine.

### Provisions governing old and new trade or business

7\. For the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) and this Act —

(a) the old trade or business of a pioneer enterprise shall be deemed to have permanently ceased at the end of its tax relief period;

(b) the pioneer enterprise shall be deemed to have set up and commenced a new trade or business on the day immediately following the end of its tax relief period;

(c) the pioneer enterprise shall make up accounts of its old trade or business for a period not exceeding one year, commencing on its production day, for successive periods of one year thereafter and for the period not exceeding one year ending at the date when its tax relief period ends; and

(d) in making up the first accounts of its new trade or business the pioneer enterprise shall take as the opening figures for those accounts the closing figures in respect of its assets and liabilities as shown in its last accounts in respect of its tax relief period, and its next accounts of its new trade or business shall be made up by reference to the closing figures in such first accounts and any subsequent accounts shall be similarly made up by reference to the closing figures of the preceding accounts of its new trade or business.

### Restrictions on trading before end of tax relief period

8\.—(1) Where, during its tax relief period, a pioneer enterprise carries on any trade or business other than the trade or business relating to the relevant pioneer product (referred to in this section as separate trade), separate accounts shall be maintained in respect of that separate trade or business and in respect of the same accounting period.

[11/2004 wef 27/11/2002]

(2) [Deleted by Act 11/2004 wef 27/11/2002]

(3) Where the carrying on of such separate trade results in a loss in any accounting period, the loss shall be brought into the computation of the income of the pioneer enterprise for that period unless the Comptroller, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, is satisfied that the loss was not incurred for the purpose of obtaining a tax advantage.

[22/87]

(4) Where the carrying on of such separate trade results in a profit in any accounting period, and the profit, computed in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) as modified by this section, amounts to less than 5% of the full sum receivable from the sale of goods or the provision of services, the statutory income from that source shall be deemed to be 5% (or such lower rate as the Comptroller may specify in any particular case) of the full sum so receivable and the income of the pioneer enterprise shall be abated accordingly.

[22/87]

(5) Where in the opinion of the Comptroller the carrying on of such separate trade is subordinate and incidental to the carrying on of the trade or business relating to the relevant pioneer product, the income or loss arising from such activities shall be deemed to form part of the income or loss of the pioneer enterprise.

(6) In this section, “relevant pioneer product” means the pioneer product specified in its pioneer certificate.

### Power to give directions

9\. For the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) and this Act, the Comptroller may direct that —

(a) any sums payable to a pioneer enterprise in any accounting period which, but for the provisions of this Act, might reasonably and properly have been expected to be payable, in the normal course of business, after the end of that period shall be treated as not having been payable in that period but as having been payable on such date, after that period, as the Comptroller thinks fit and, where that date is after the end of the tax relief period of the pioneer enterprise, as having been so payable, on that date, as a sum payable in respect of its new trade or business; and

(b) any expense incurred by a pioneer enterprise within one year after the end of its tax relief period which, but for the provisions of this Act, might reasonably and properly have been expected to be incurred, in the normal course of business, during its tax relief period shall be treated as not having been incurred within that year but as having been incurred for the purposes of its old trade or business and on such date, during its tax relief period, as the Comptroller thinks fit.

### Ascertainment of income in respect of old trade or business

10\.—(1) The income of a pioneer enterprise in respect of its old trade or business shall be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act after making such adjustments as may be necessary in consequence of any direction given under section 9.

(1A) In determining the income of a pioneer enterprise referred to in subsection (1), the allowances provided for in sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Income Tax Act shall be taken into account notwithstanding that no claim for such allowances has been made.

(1B) Where the tax relief period of a pioneer enterprise referred to in subsection (1) expires during the basis period for any year of assessment, for the purpose of determining the income in respect of its old trade or business and its new trade or business for that year of assessment, there shall be deducted allowances provided for in sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Income Tax Act notwithstanding that no claim for such allowances has been made; and for the purpose of computing such allowances —

(a) the allowances for that year of assessment shall be computed as if the old trade or business of the pioneer enterprise had not been deemed to have permanently ceased at the end of the tax relief period; and

(b) the allowances computed in accordance with paragraph (a) shall be apportioned between the old trade or business and the new trade or business of the pioneer enterprise in such manner as appears to the Comptroller to be reasonable in the circumstances.

[36/93]

(a) where the pre-relief income equals or exceeds the expansion income, no relief shall be given;

(ii) which before 1st January 2003 had been subjected to the provisions of section 44 of that Act in force immediately before that date and the dividend is paid on or after —

(5) The expanding enterprise shall deliver to the Comptroller a copy of that account, made up to a date specified by him, whenever called upon to do so by notice in writing sent by him to its registered office, until such time as he is satisfied that there is no further need for maintaining the account.

(6) Notwithstanding section 24 and subsections (1) to (5), where it appears to the Comptroller that —

(a) any amount of exempted income of an expanding enterprise; or

(b) any dividend exempted in the hands of any shareholder,

ought not to have been exempted by reason of a direction under section 9 (as applied to this Part by section 23) or the revocation under section 99 of an expansion certificate issued to the expanding enterprise, the Comptroller may, subject to section 74 of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) —

(i) make such assessment or additional assessment upon the expanding enterprise or any such shareholder as may appear to be necessary in order to counteract any profit obtained from any such amount; or

(ii) direct the expanding enterprise to debit its account, kept in accordance with subsection (1), with such amount as the circumstances require.

[1/95]

### Conditions for relief

38\.—(1) The tax relief provided under this Part applies to an export enterprise during its tax relief period subject to the following conditions:

(a) in respect of the first year of assessment, for which the export year forms the basis period, the export sales shall amount, in proportion, to not less than 20% of the total sales and, in value, to not less than $100,000 during that accounting period;

(b) in respect of subsequent years of assessment, subject to the export sales having satisfied that minimum proportion and value in the export year or where a direction has been made by the Minister under subsection (2) in respect of that year, the export sales shall amount in value to not less than $100,000 during the relevant accounting period; and

(c) where the minimum requirements as to proportion and value have not been satisfied in the export year, and no direction has been made by the Minister under subsection (2), the relief provided by this Part shall apply for the first time only in respect of a year of assessment where during the relevant accounting period the minimum requirements as to proportion and value have both been satisfied or where a direction to this effect has been made by the Minister under subsection (2), and thereafter shall continue to be available where during the relevant accounting period the minimum requirement as to value has been satisfied.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), where, in its export year, the export sales of an export enterprise amount in value to $100,000 or more, but in proportion, to less than 20% of the total sales, and the Minister is satisfied, on the representations of the enterprise that the failure to realise that proportion of the total sales was due to causes beyond the control of the enterprise, or having regard to the quantum of its output and sales other than export sales, it is reasonable and expedient in the public interest to do so, the Minister may direct that the relief provided under this Part shall apply in respect of the year of assessment corresponding to its export year or in respect of any subsequent year of assessment during its tax relief period.

### Tax relief on export profits

39\.—(1) Where an amount of the export profit of an export enterprise qualifies under sections 37 and 38 for the relief provided by this section (referred to in this section as the qualifying export profit), there shall be deducted from that amount such part of the allowances provided for in sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 19A, 20, 21 and 22 of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) as may be attributable to the qualifying export profit.

(1A) The part of the allowances referred to in subsection (1) so attributable to the qualifying export profit shall be deemed to be such amount which bears the same proportion to the total allowances deductible by the export enterprise under sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 19A, 20, 21 and 22 of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) (notwithstanding that no claim for such allowances has been made) as the amount of the qualifying export profit bears to the income of the export enterprise ascertained under section 37(1).

[32/79]

(2) For each year of assessment the Comptroller shall issue to the export enterprise a statement for that year of assessment showing the balance of the qualifying export profit after deduction of the allowances under subsection (1) and the provisions of Parts XVII and XVIII of the Income Tax Act (relating to objections and appeals) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, as if such a statement were a notice of assessment given under those provisions.

(3) Subject to section 40(6), where any statement issued under subsection (2) has become final and conclusive, an amount equal to 90% of the balance of such qualifying export profit shall not form part of the statutory income of the export enterprise for that year of assessment and shall be exempt from tax.

(B) the company exercises the option referred to in section 44(6A) of that Act; or

(C) 31st December 2007,

(6) Notwithstanding section 39 and subsections (1) to (5), where it appears to the Comptroller that —

(a) any amount of exempted income of an export enterprise; or

(b) any dividend exempted in the hands of any shareholder,

ought not to have been exempted by reason of a direction under section 9, as applied to this Part by section 33, having been made with respect to the export enterprise, after any income of that enterprise has been exempted under the provisions of this Act or the revocation under section 99 of a certificate issued to the export enterprise, the Comptroller may, subject to section 74 of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) —

(i) make such assessment or additional assessment upon the export enterprise or any such shareholders as may appear to be necessary in order to counteract any profit obtained from any such amount which ought not to have been exempted; or

(ii) direct the export enterprise to debit its account, kept in accordance with subsection (1), with such amount as the circumstances require.

[1/95]

Notwithstanding any written law to the contrary, if there is reasonable cause to believe that an offence has been or is being committed under section 36 or 42 of this Act or the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (Cap. 272A) in relation to any export product or export produce, sections 90 and 91 and Part XIII of the Customs Act (Cap. 70) (relating to search, seizure and arrest) shall apply, insofar as they are applicable, as if the export product or export produce were goods that were dutiable and uncustomed goods or goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act, and as if the offence had been or were being committed under that Act.

[24/95]

### Offence under other laws deemed to be an offence under this Act

44\. Where an export product or export produce is the subject-matter of an offence committed under the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act or the Customs Act, and the Comptroller is satisfied that, if the offence had not been detected, the export enterprise concerned in the commission of such an offence would have been able to claim relief from tax to which it was not entitled, then such an offence shall be deemed to be an offence under this Act whether a claim for tax relief has been made or not and may be dealt with accordingly but so that no person shall be punished more than once for the same offence.
