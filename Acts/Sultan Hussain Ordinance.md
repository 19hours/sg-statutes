Whereas in or about the year 1819 certain land situate in Kampong Glam in Singapore, and estimated to contain an area of about 23 hectares, was set apart by the Honourable East India Company for the accommodation and benefit of Sultan Hussain Mahomed Shah (hereinafter called Sultan Hussain) and His Heirs and Successors:

And Whereas the said Sultan Hussain occupied the said land until shortly before his death, which took place at Malacca in the year 1835:

And Whereas the said Sultan Hussain left him surviving his eldest son Sultan Ali Iskander Shah (hereinafter called Sultan Ali) and 2 younger sons:

And Whereas the said Sultan Ali occupied the said land and granted leases of portions thereof to divers persons:

And Whereas the said Sultan Ali died in the year 1877, leaving him surviving his eldest son, Tunku Allum, and divers other children:

And Whereas the said Tunku Allum until his death occupied the said land and collected the rents of such portion thereof as was under lease, and supported the members of the family of the late Sultan Ali, according to Malay royal custom:

And Whereas disputes and litigation about the said land have taken place between the said Tunku Ali and the other descendants of the said Sultan Hussain, deceased:

And Whereas by a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Colony, delivered on 23rd December 1897, it was decided that the said land must be considered as Crown land, no longer subject to the treaties which previously affected it, but as having been occupied by the said Tunku Allum without legal right or title:
