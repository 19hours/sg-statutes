“approved person or organisation” means a person or an organisation that has been approved by the Minister in writing for the purposes of this Act;

### Applications for maintenance orders

3\.—(1) Any person domiciled and resident in Singapore who is of or above 60 years of age and who is unable to maintain himself adequately (referred to in this section as the parent) may apply to the Tribunal for an order that one or more of his children pay him a monthly allowance or any other periodical payment or a lump sum for his maintenance.

(2) An approved person or organisation in whose care a parent resides may apply to the Tribunal for an order that one or more of his children pay the approved person or organisation a monthly allowance or any other periodical payment or a lump sum for the purpose of defraying the costs and expenses of maintaining the parent.

(2A) Where any person wishes to make an application under this section, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of a parent, in respect of any claim for which no application had previously been made under this section, he shall, before making the application, refer the claim to the Commissioner for review under section 12(5).

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

(3) Where the parent ceases to be in the care of the approved person or organisation, any part of the monthly allowance, other periodical payment or lump sum remaining, after deducting the reasonable costs and expenses of maintaining the parent, shall be held in trust for the parent.

(4) For the purposes of this section, a parent is unable to maintain himself if his total or expected income and other financial resources are inadequate to provide him with basic amenities and basic physical needs including (but not limited to) shelter, food, medical costs and clothing.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

(5) Notwithstanding that a person is below the minimum age specified in subsection (1), this Act shall apply to that person if the Tribunal is satisfied that he is suffering from infirmity of mind or body which prevents him from maintaining or makes it difficult for him to maintain himself or that there is any other special reason.

(6) The President or a deputy President of the Tribunal may dismiss any application made under this section, if he is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or if the applicant has failed to comply with subsection (2A), and give the reasons for the dismissal.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

(7) An applicant who is aggrieved by any decision made under subsection (6) may, within 14 days of the decision, appeal in writing to the Tribunal.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

(8) The President or deputy President, as the case may be, who made the decision under subsection (6) that is under appeal shall not participate in the proceedings or determination of the appeal.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

### Joinder of respondents

4\. A respondent may serve notice in the prescribed form on other persons liable to maintain the applicant joining them as respondents in the action.

### Maintenance orders

5\.—(1) The Tribunal may make a maintenance order if it considers that it is just and equitable that the respondent should maintain the applicant and that —

(a) the respondent is able to provide maintenance to the applicant after his own requirements and those of his spouse and his children have been supplied; and

(b) the applicant is unable, in spite of efforts on his part, to maintain himself through work or from his property or from any other source.

(2) When ordering maintenance for the benefit of an applicant, the Tribunal shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including (but not limited to) the following matters:

(a) the financial needs of the applicant, taking into account reasonable expenses for housing and medical costs;

(b) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of the applicant and the manner in which an applicant has spent his savings or dissipated his financial resources;

(c) any physical or mental disability of the applicant;

(d) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of the respondent;

(e) the expenses incurred by the respondent in supporting his spouse or children;

(f) the contributions and provisions, whether financial or otherwise, which the respondent has made for the maintenance of the applicant.

(2A) Without prejudice to the Tribunal’s powers under the Act, the President or a deputy President of the Tribunal may, with the consent of the applicant and the respondent, make a maintenance order reflecting the terms of any agreement reached between the parties in respect of a claim, and such order shall be deemed to be a maintenance order made by the Tribunal under this Act and enforceable in accordance with its terms.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

(3) If the Tribunal is satisfied upon due proof that the applicant abandoned, abused or neglected the respondent, it may dismiss the application or may reduce the quantum of maintenance ordered by such amount as may be just.

(4) The onus of proving abandonment, abuse or neglect shall be on the respondent alleging it.

(5) Where there is more than one respondent, the Tribunal may apportion the maintenance among the various respondents in such manner as may be just.

(6) The Tribunal shall, before hearing an application under this section, refer the differences between the parties to a conciliation officer for mediation between the parties.

### Power of Tribunal to order security for maintenance

6\.—(1) A maintenance order may provide for the payment of a lump sum, or a monthly allowance or periodical payment for such period as the Tribunal may determine.

(2) The Tribunal may, in its discretion, when awarding maintenance, order the respondent to secure the whole or any part of it by vesting any property in trustees upon trust to pay the maintenance or part thereof out of the income from that property.

(3) The Tribunal may, in awarding maintenance, order the applicant to —

(a) deposit such minimum sum as the Tribunal may determine with a bank; or

(b) purchase an annuity with an insurer with such minimum sum.

(4) The Tribunal may, in awarding maintenance, give directions as to the manner or method of payment.

### Duration of orders for maintenance

7\.—(1) Except where an order for maintenance is expressed to be for any shorter period or where any such order has been rescinded, a maintenance order shall expire —

(a) if the maintenance was unsecured, on the death of the applicant or the respondent, whichever is the earlier;

(b) if the maintenance was secured, on the death of the applicant.

(2) Where a maintenance order was made against more than one respondent, the death of a respondent does not affect the liability of the others to continue paying maintenance to the applicant.

(3) The applicant may apply to the Tribunal to re-apportion the liability among the surviving respondents on the death of a respondent.

### Power of Tribunal to vary orders for maintenance

8\.—(1) The Tribunal may vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances of the applicant or respondents or where another person is joined as a respondent, or for other good cause shown to the satisfaction of the Tribunal.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

(2) An application for variation of a maintenance order may be made by —

(a) the applicant;

(b) a respondent;

(c) the Commissioner;

(d) an approved person or organisation referred to in section 3(2); or

(e) in respect of secured maintenance, the legal personal representatives of a respondent.

(3) Where a maintenance order was made against more than one respondent or another respondent is joined, the Tribunal may re-apportion in such manner as it considers just the maintenance upon an application to vary the maintenance order.

(4) The Tribunal may, before hearing an application under this section and where it considers it necessary or desirable to do so, refer the differences between the parties to a conciliation officer for mediation.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

### Maintenance payable under order of Tribunal to be inalienable

### Enforcement of maintenance orders

10\.—(1) Maintenance orders made under this Act shall be deemed to be orders made by a District Court and may be enforced in the same manner as maintenance orders for wives and children are enforced under the Women’s Charter, and the provisions of that Act shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to enforcement of orders made under this Act.

[37/2010 wef 15/03/2011]

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the District Court may adopt such measures as it deems relevant or appropriate for the enforcement of maintenance orders made under this Act.
