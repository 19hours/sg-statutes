### Grants with exception

### Administration when limited grant expired and still some part of estate unadministered

27\. When a limited grant has expired by effluxion of time or the happening of the event or contingency on which it was limited, and there is still some part of the deceased’s estate unadministered, letters of administration shall be granted to those persons to whom original grants might have been made.

## PART IV

OATH

### Oath

28\. Upon the grant of any probate or letters of administration, the grantee shall take an oath in the prescribed form, faithfully to administer the estate and to account for the same. This section shall not apply where the grantee is the Public Trustee or the official assignee or a trust company.

## PART V

SECURITY

### Administration bond

29\.—(1) Where security is required the registrar shall determine its sufficiency.

(2) The security shall ordinarily be by bond in the prescribed form by the grantee and two sureties in the amount at which the estate within the jurisdiction is sworn, without deduction of any debts due by the deceased, other than debts secured by mortgage; but the court or a judge or any registrar whom the Chief Justice may specially appoint for that purpose may for any sufficient reason increase or decrease the number of the sureties, or dispense with them, or reduce the amount of the bond.

(3) Where the official assignee has obtained a grant of letters of administration, he shall not be required to give security.

(4) When the administrator is entitled to the whole of the estate after payment of the debts, sureties in the bond may ordinarily be dispensed with.

(5) Sureties may be required by the registrar to justify.

(6) In the case of administrations whether with or without the will annexed the person to whom the grant is made or on whose behalf it is sealed shall give security for the due administration of the estate.

### Bond by creditor administrator

30\. When letters of administration are granted to a creditor, he may be required to enter into a bond to pay the debts of the deceased rateably, without preferring his own debt.

### Assignment of bond

31\. The court or a judge may, if it appears that the condition of an administration bond has been broken, order that it be assigned by the registrar to some named person, who shall thereupon be entitled to sue on the bond under his own name on behalf of all persons interested in the estate in respect of which the bond was executed, as though it had originally been made in his favour.

## PART VI

REVOCATION OF GRANT

### Revocation of grant

32\. Any probate or letters of administration may be revoked or amended for any sufficient cause.

## PART VII

CAVEATS

### Caveat

33\. Any person having or claiming to have interest may, at any time after the death of a deceased person and before probate or letters of administration have been granted to his estate, enter a general caveat, so that no probate or letters of administration shall be granted without notice to the caveator, and after entry of any such caveat no such grant shall be made until the caveator has been given opportunity to contest the right of any petitioner to a grant.

## PART VIII

DISTRICT COURTS

### Jurisdiction of District Courts

34\.—(1) District Courts shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred on them by any written law for the time being in force relating to the courts in accordance with this Act, subject to sections 35 and 36 and to the Subordinate Courts Rules*.

(2) A District Court may, subject to the Subordinate Courts Rules*, allow any citation issued under section 4 or under any such Rules to be served out of the jurisdiction by registered post upon any person required to be served therewith wherever he may be whether in Singapore or elsewhere.

SeeG.N. No. S 59/86.

[7/76]

### Grants in excess of jurisdiction not to be invalid

35\.—(1) No probate or letters of administration granted by a District Court shall be invalid by reason of the assets and effects of the deceased being subsequently found to be of greater value than $250,000; but the grantee shall be liable for the estate duty payable in respect of the true value of the estate, and for all such court fees as would have been payable had application for the grant been made to the High Court; and he shall be required to give such security for the due administration of the estate as is required in the case of a grant by the High Court.

(2) Unless in such case the grantee complies without delay with the requirements of subsection (1), the grant may be revoked, on the application of the Commissioner of Estate Duties, or of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, or of any person having any interest as beneficiary or creditor in the assets of the estate.

[7/76]

[3/87]

### Security in case of grant of administration by District Court

36\. A grantee of letters of administration from the District Court shall not be required to give security for the due administration of the estate, unless the person for whose use and benefit the grant is made is an infant, or unless in any other case the District Court thinks fit to require such security.

## PART IX

PROTECTION OF ESTATES PENDING GRANT

### Vesting of estate in certain circumstances between death and grant of administration

37\.—(1) Where a person dies intestate, his real and personal estate shall vest in the Public Trustee.

(2) Where a testator dies and —

(a) at the time of his death there is no executor with power to obtain probate of the will; or

(b) at any time before probate of the will is granted there ceases to be any executor with power to obtain probate,

the real and personal estate of which the testator disposes by the will shall vest in the Public Trustee with effect from the time specified in paragraph (a) or (b) in relation to each case.

(3) The vesting by virtue of this section of any estate in the Public Trustee shall not, without more, confer or impose on him any power, duty, right, equity, obligation or liability in respect of the estate.

(4) Any estate or part of an estate vested in the Public Trustee under subsection (1) or (2) shall cease to be so vested on the grant of administration in respect of the estate or part in question.

### Transitional and savings

(2) Subject to subsection (3), the amendment made to this Act by the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1997 applies in respect of a person’s estate whether the person died before or after the appointed day.

(3) Where, but for this subsection, the vesting under section 37 (as amended by the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1997) of any estate of a testator would have effect from a time before the appointed day, the vesting shall have effect from that day and section 37(2) shall have effect subject to this.

[7/97 wef 01/10/1997]

### Receiver pending grant

38\. Where any person dies leaving property within Singapore, the court or a judge may, if it appears, on the application by motion of the official assignee or of any person claiming to be interested in the property, or having the custody or control thereof at the time of the death of the deceased, or being at such time an attorney of the deceased, that there is danger that the property may be wasted, appoint the official assignee or such other person as the court or judge thinks fit, to be a receiver of the property pending a grant of probate or letters of administration.

### Sale by order of court

39\. The court or a judge may, on application by a receiver appointed under section 38, or any person interested in the estate, order the sale of the whole or any part of such property, if it appears that such sale will be beneficial to the estate.

### Application of rules relating to receivers

40\. A receiver appointed under section 38 shall be subject to all Rules of Court relating to receivers generally, but neither the official assignee nor the Public Trustee shall be required to furnish security.

### Penalty

41\. Any person who, without lawful authority, removes or attempts to remove from Singapore any portion of the property of which a receiver has been appointed under section 38, or destroys, conceals, or refuses to yield up the same to the receiver, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction by a Magistrate’s Court to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

### No suit against receiver

42\.
