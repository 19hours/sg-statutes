(a) any officer on his attaining the minimum age of retirement applicable to him specified in subsection (2)(a), (b) or (h) who, having retired from the public service of Singapore under the provisions of the Instruction Manual for the time being in force in order to be nominated as a candidate for election as a member of Parliament or of any local government authority in Singapore, has not subsequently been re-employed in the public service of Singapore:

Provided that —

(i) where the President is satisfied that such an officer is physically or mentally incapacitated so as to be unable to continue in any employment before he has attained the minimum age of retirement applicable to him, he may be granted a pension, gratuity or other allowance with effect from the date he satisfies the President that he is so physically or mentally incapacitated; or

### Retirement in the public interest

8\.—(1) Where an officer’s service is terminated on the ground that, having regard to the conditions of the public service, the usefulness of the officer thereto and all the other circumstances of the case, such termination is desirable in the public interest, and a pension, gratuity or other allowance cannot otherwise be granted to him under the provisions of this Act, the President may, if he thinks fit, grant such pension, gratuity or other allowance as he thinks just and proper, not exceeding in amount that for which the officer would be eligible if he retired from the public service in the circumstances described in section 7(2)(c).

9\. It shall be lawful for the President to require any officer to retire from the public service in Singapore —

(a) who has attained, in the case of a male officer in the public service in Singapore at the commencement of this Act, the age of 55 years, and in the case of any other male officer the age of 60 years or 55 years if the President in any individual case so directs;

(b) who, being a police officer below the rank of assistant superintendent, prison officer below the rank of superintendent or a male nurse at a Government mental hospital, has attained the age of 45 years;

(g) who has attained, in the case of a female officer appointed to the public service on or after 1st March 1962, the age of 60 years or 55 years if the President in any individual case so directs.

### Maximum pension from all public service

10\.—(1) A pension granted to an officer under this Act shall not exceed two-thirds of the highest pensionable emoluments drawn by him at any time in the course of his public service in Singapore.

(2) Where an officer has been or is granted a pension or pensions in respect of other public service, he may be granted the full pension for which he is eligible in respect of his public service in Singapore, but no person may at any time draw from the Consolidated Fund an amount of pension which, when added to the amount of any pension or pensions drawn in respect of other public service, exceeds two-thirds of the highest pensionable emoluments drawn by that person at any time in the course of his public service in Singapore or in other public service:

Provided that where such a person receives, in respect of some period of public service, both a gratuity and a pension, the amount of such pension shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subsection, to be the amount of pension which would have been payable had the officer received a pension only and not a gratuity and a pension.

(3) In a case falling under the limitation laid down by subsection (2), the amount of pension to be drawn from the Consolidated Fund shall be subject to the approval of the President, in order that it may be determined with due regard to the amount of any pension or pensions similarly to be drawn in respect of other public service.

(4) For the purpose of subsections (1), (2) and (3), an allowance granted in respect of injury or disease shall not be taken into account; but where the officer is granted such an allowance the amount of such allowance which he may draw shall not exceed one-sixth of his highest pensionable emoluments at any time in the course of his public service by more than the sum by which the amount of his pension or pensions, apart from such allowance, falls short of two-thirds of such highest pensionable emoluments.

### Pensions, etc., not to be assignable

11\. A pension, gratuity or other allowance granted under this Act shall not be assignable or transferable, except for the purpose of satisfying —

(a) a debt due to the Government; or

(b) an order of any court for the payment of periodical sums of money towards the maintenance of the wife or former wife or minor child, whether legitimate or not, of the officer to whom the pension, gratuity or other allowance has been granted,

and shall not be liable to be attached, sequestered or levied upon for or in respect of any debt or claim whatever except a debt due to the Government.

### Liability of pensioners to be called upon to take further employment

12\.—(1) Every pension granted under this Act shall be subject to the condition that unless and until the officer shall have reached the age of 50 years if a man, and of 45 years if a woman, he may, if physically fit for service, be called upon by the President to accept an office, in Singapore, not less in value than the office which he held at the date of retirement.

(2) If a pensioner so called upon declines to accept such office, the payment of his pension may be suspended until he has attained the age of 50 years if a man, and of 45 years if a woman.

(3) This section shall not apply to officers in the public service in Singapore at the commencement of this Act who retire otherwise than in the circumstances described in section 7(2)(d) or (f).

### Pensions, etc., to cease on bankruptcy

13\.—(1) No pension, gratuity or other allowance which would under this Act be granted to an officer shall be so granted if, at the date of his retirement from the public service, such officer has been adjudged a bankrupt or declared insolvent by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, and has not obtained his discharge from such adjudication or declaration.

(2) If any person to whom a pension or other allowance has been granted under this Act is adjudicated a bankrupt or is declared insolvent by judgment of the court, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, then such pension or allowance shall forthwith cease.

(3) In any case where, by reason of bankruptcy or insolvency of the officer, a pension, gratuity or allowance is not granted or where a pension or allowance ceases by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the pensioner, it shall be lawful for the President, from time to time, during the remainder of such pensioner’s life, or during such shorter period or periods, either continuous or discontinuous, as he shall think fit, to cause all or any part of the moneys to which such person would have been entitled by way of pension, gratuity or allowance, had he not become a bankrupt or insolvent, to be paid to, or applied for the maintenance and personal support or benefit of, all or any, to the exclusion of the other or others, of the following persons, namely, such pensioner himself and any wife, child or children of his, in such proportions and manner as the President thinks proper, and such moneys shall be paid or applied accordingly; moneys applied for the discharge of the debts of the officer or pensioner shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be regarded as applied for his benefit.

(4) When a person to whom a pension or allowance has not been granted or whose pension or allowance has ceased under this section obtains a full and proper discharge from his bankruptcy or insolvency, his pension or allowance shall be restored to him with effect from the date of such discharge.

### Pensions, etc., to cease on conviction

14\.—(1) If any person to whom a pension or other allowance has been granted under this Act is sentenced to death or penal servitude or any term of imprisonment, by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, for any crime or offence, it shall be lawful for the President to direct that such pension or allowance shall forthwith cease, and thereupon such pension or allowance shall cease accordingly:

Provided that the pension or allowance shall be restored with retrospective effect in the case of a person who after conviction at any time receives a free pardon.

(2) Where a pension or allowance ceases by virtue of a direction under subsection (1), it shall be lawful for the President to cause all or any part of moneys to which the pensioner would have been entitled by way of pension or allowance to be paid to or applied for the benefit of any wife, child or children of the pensioner, or after the expiration of his sentence, also for the benefit of the pensioner himself, in the same manner precisely and subject to the same qualifications and restrictions as in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency hereinbefore provided.

### Pensions, etc., may cease on accepting employment in certain companies, or in engaging in certain occupations for gain

15\.—(1) If any person to whom a pension or other allowance has been granted under this Act becomes either a director of any company, the principal part of whose business is in any way directly concerned with Singapore or Malaysia, or an officer or servant employed in Singapore or in Malaysia by any such company, or engages in any occupation for gain in Singapore or in Malaysia, without in every such case the permission of the President in writing first had and obtained, then, in every such case, it shall be lawful for the President to direct that such pension or allowance shall forthwith cease, and thereupon such pension or allowance shall cease accordingly:

Provided always that it shall be lawful for the President on being satisfied that the person in respect of whose pension or allowance any such direction shall have been given has ceased to be a director of such company or to be employed as an officer or servant of such company in Singapore or in Malaysia or has ceased to be engaged in such occupation as aforesaid, as the case may be, to give directions for the restoration of such pension or allowance, with retrospective effect if he shall see fit, to such date as he shall specify, and such pension or allowance shall be restored accordingly.

(2) This section shall cease to apply to any person to whom a pension or other allowance has been granted under this Act after a period of 5 years from the date of his retirement.

### Gratuity where officer dies in service

16\.—(1) Where an officer dies in the public service in Singapore, there shall be paid to such of his dependants as the President may think fit, or if there are no dependants, to his legal personal representative, a gratuity —

(a) in the case of an officer holding a pensionable office who has not exercised an option mentioned in section 3(2), of an amount equal to 1/120 of one year’s pensionable emoluments for each complete month of service but such gratuity shall not be less than one year’s or more than 3 years’ pensionable emoluments;

(b) in the case of an officer holding a pensionable office who has exercised an option mentioned in section 3(2), one year’s salary as at the date immediately prior to his option taking effect or the commuted pension gratuity which might have been granted to the officer if he had retired at the date of his death in the circumstances described in section 7(2)(c), whichever is the greater;

(c) in any other case one year’s salary or his commuted annual allowance gratuity, whichever is the greater.

(2) Where an officer who has retired from the public service in Singapore dies within one year of his retirement, there shall be paid to such of his dependants as the President may think fit, or if there are no dependants, to his legal personal representative, a gratuity of an amount equal, in the case of an officer holding a pensionable office who has not exercised an option mentioned in section 3(2), to one year’s pensionable emoluments and, in any other case, to one year’s salary, from which gratuity there shall be deducted the amount of the gratuity, if any, which has been paid or is payable under this Act or any regulations made thereunder and any payment or payments of pension or allowance, other than any allowance granted in respect of an injury, which may already have been made.

(3) A gratuity (except for commuted annual allowance gratuity) to be granted under subsection (1) or (2) shall be reduced —

(a) in the case of an officer transferred to the service of the Government from the service of an authority mentioned in Part II of the Second Schedule under any written law for the time being in force providing that service with that authority shall be deemed to have been service with the Government for the purposes of this Act —

(i) by the total amount paid by the Government and that authority to any of the funds mentioned in Part I of the Second Schedule, excluding the amount paid on account of the officer if he is on the pensionable establishment with respect to such service, or an equivalent amount if he is not on the pensionable establishment with respect to such service with the Government and with that authority, together with the interest accrued thereon; and

(ii) by the sum of money, if any, payable under the Singapore City Council Superannuation Fund for Subordinate Employees Rules 1954 in respect of the death of the officer; and

(b) in the case of an officer not transferred to the service of the Government from the service of an authority as aforesaid and not in the public service on 31st March 1962, by the total amount paid by the Government to the Central Provident Fund, excluding the amount paid on account of the officer if he is on the pensionable establishment with respect to his public service or an equivalent amount if he is not on the pensionable establishment with respect to his public service.

(4) For the purposes of this section —

“one year’s salary” means the emoluments which would be taken for the purpose of computing any allowance or gratuity, or in the case of an officer holding a pensionable office who has exercised an option mentioned in section 3(2) any pension, which may be granted to the officer if he had retired at the date of his death in the circumstances described in section 7(2)(c);

“commuted annual allowance gratuity” means the gratuity which might have been granted to the officer under any regulation providing for the grant of a reduced annual allowance and a gratuity, if his public service had been wholly in Singapore and if he had retired at the date of his death in the circumstances described in section 7(2)(c); and for the purpose of calculating the same the officer shall be deemed to have elected to be paid an annual allowance at the rate of three-fourths of the annual allowance granted to him.

General Regulations

Citation

1\. These Regulations may be cited as the Pensions Regulations.

Definitions

2. In these Regulations, unless the context otherwise requires —

“Malayan Government” includes the Governments of the Federated Malay States and any State or Settlement now comprised in the Federation of Malaya and the Government of the Malayan Union;

“period of enemy occupation” means the period commencing on 15th February 1942 and ending on 5th September 1945.

Regulations subject to the Act

3\. These Regulations shall in all respects be subject to the provisions of the Act.

Period of service qualifying for pension, etc.

4\. Subject to these Regulations, service qualifying for pension, gratuity or other allowance, as the case may be, shall be the inclusive period between the date from which an officer commences to draw salary or half salary from the funds of the Government and the date of his leaving the service of the Government without deduction of any period during which he has been absent on leave.

Pensions to whom and at what rates to be granted

5. Every officer holding a pensionable office in Singapore, who has been in the service of the Government for not less than 10 years, may on his retirement be granted a pension at the rate of one six-hundredth (1/600th) of his annual pensionable emoluments in respect of each complete month of pensionable service subject to the limit prescribed in section 10 of the Act:

Provided that an officer in the public service in Singapore at the commencement of the Act may be permitted to draw pension at the rate of one seven-hundred-and-twentieth (1/720th) of his pensionable emoluments in respect of each complete month of pensionable service with an addition of sixty seven-hundred-and-twentieths (60/720ths) of his pensionable emoluments subject to the limit prescribed in section 10 of the Act.

Pensionable service

6.—(1) For the purpose of computing the amount of a pension or gratuity to be granted to an officer, the following periods, subject to any deduction to be made under regulation 9, shall be taken into account as pensionable service —

(a) the periods during which he has been on duty;

(b) any period during which he was proceeding to Singapore, on first appointment and in respect of which he was paid half or full salary from the funds of the Government;

(c) any period during which he has been absent from duty on leave with full salary or half salary;

(d) any period during which he has been absent from duty on leave without salary, granted on grounds of public policy with the approval of the President, and during which he has not qualified for pension or gratuity in respect of other public service;

(e) any period during which an officer shall have been seconded for other public service or for service under a public body with the approval of the President, or may have been seconded for service under any Malayan Government;

(f) any period during which an officer has been granted leave without salary to serve under a private body with the approval of the President unless the officer has exercised an irrevocable option not to have the period taken into account as pensionable service.

[S 31/1993 wef 19/02/1993]

(2) The period of enemy occupation and any period subsequent thereto before an officer resumed duty may, unless in any particular case the President shall otherwise direct, be counted as service qualifying for a pension or gratuity or allowance as if the enemy occupation had not occurred and in particular no officer otherwise eligible for the grant of any pension, gratuity or allowance shall be disqualified from counting such service merely by reason of the fact that, during the period of enemy occupation or such subsequent period as aforesaid, he was absent from duty or that his service was broken or that he was not in receipt of full salary:

Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any officer who, being available and fit for duty, did not report for duty within such time, after the expiration of the period of enemy occupation, as the President may, in the circumstances of this case, consider reasonable.

(3) Subject to any direction to the contrary by the President, it shall be assumed, in the computation of the amount of any pension, gratuity or allowance in respect of past services which involves taking into account the period of enemy occupation or any period subsequent thereto before an officer resumed duty, that, during such period or periods, the officer concerned continued to draw salary and any other pensionable emoluments to which he would have been entitled but for the enemy occupation.

(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3) —

(a) no promotion dependent on selection or the occurrence of vacancies shall be presumed to have taken place during the period of enemy occupation;

(b) where an officer on 14th February 1942 held an office or served as an officer of a class under an approved scheme the pensionable emoluments of which are based on a scale of increments, then such pensionable emoluments of such office or officer shall be calculated so as to include such increments as the officer would ordinarily have received during the period of enemy occupation or subsequent period mentioned in paragraph (3); and

(c) in the case of an officer who continued in the service of the Japanese Military Government and who was retired during the period of enemy occupation after a medical examination which, in the opinion of the President, was sufficient, paragraph (3) shall cease to apply as from the date of such retirement.

Service to be unbroken

7.—(1) Service in respect of which pensions or gratuities may be granted must be unbroken, except in cases where the service has been interrupted by abolition of office or other temporary suspension of employment not arising from misconduct or voluntary resignation or the break in service is caused by retirement under the provisions of the Instruction Manual for the time being in force on the election of an officer as a Member of Parliament or of any local government authority.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an officer —

(a) whose pension has been suspended under regulation 16; or

(b) who has retired from the public service without pension on account of ill-health, abolition of office or re-organisation designed to effect greater efficiency and economy, and has subsequently been re-employed in the public service,

may, if the President thinks fit, be granted the pension or gratuity for which he would have been eligible if any break in his public service immediately prior to such suspension, re-employment or employment had not occurred and such pension shall be in lieu of —

(i) any pension previously granted to him in respect of his service under the Government; and

(ii) any gratuity so granted which is required to be refunded as a condition of the application to the officer of this paragraph,

but in addition to any gratuity so granted which is not required to be refunded as aforesaid: Provided that in calculating a pension or gratuity granted in pursuance of this paragraph no account shall be taken for any purposes of the period during which the officer was not in public service.

Acting service

8. Where an officer has performed acting service in a pensionable office under the Government, the period of such service may be taken into account as pensionable service if the period of such acting service —

(a) was not part of the pensionable service of a substantive holder of the office and is not taken into account as part of the officer’s own pensionable service in other public service; and

(b) is immediately preceded or followed by service in a substantive capacity in a pensionable office under the Government or in an office which is a pensionable office as regards previous service, and not otherwise.

Non-pensionable service when to count

9. Only service in a pensionable office shall be taken into account as pensionable service: Provided that —

(a) where a period of service in a civil capacity otherwise than in a pensionable office is immediately followed by service in a pensionable office and the officer is confirmed therein the whole of such period may be so taken into account;

(b) any break in service which may be disregarded under regulation 7 (2) may likewise be disregarded in determining for the purposes of the preceding proviso whether one period of service immediately follows another period of service;

(c) any period during which an officer on the pensionable establishment has served on duty in Malaya or in Brunei Darussalam, whether in a pensionable office or not, may be regarded as pensionable service;

(d) any period during which an officer, on the pensionable or non-pensionable establishment, has served in Singapore with the Board of Currency Commissioners, Malaya, may be regarded as pensionable service; and

(e) any period during which an officer has served in the Singapore Armed Forces immediately prior to his transfer to the public service and which period would have counted as pensionable service under the appropriate Singapore Armed Forces pensions regulations, may be regarded as pensionable service.

War service how reckoned

10\. Any period during which an officer absent on leave from Singapore has, with the consent of the President, served with the Singapore Armed Forces or in any capacity connected with a state of war, may be reckoned as service on full pay for the purposes of these Regulations.

Full-time national service is deemed to be public service and the period of such service may be reckoned as pensionable service

11.—(1) Full-time national service pursuant to section 10 of the Enlistment Act or pursuant to the provisions of any written law repealed by that Act, shall be deemed to be public service and a person who has rendered such service, either before or after he became the holder of a pensionable office, shall be deemed to have been or to have continued to be, as the case may be, an officer in the public service for the period of such full-time national service for the purposes of the Act.

(2) Any period during which a person has rendered full-time national service pursuant to section 10 of the Enlistment Act or pursuant to the provisions of any written law repealed by that Act, may be reckoned as service qualifying for pension, gratuity or other allowance, as the case may be.

(3) The period between the effective date of a person’s release from full-time national service and the date of his assumption of duty or resumption of duty, as the case may be, in the public service may be deemed to be a period of temporary suspension of employment for the purposes of the Act.

[10A

Officers seconded to a public body

12. Where an officer has been seconded from a pensionable office to an office or class of office which is not pensionable or to service under a public body, the period of such temporary employment shall be reckoned for the purpose of pension, gratuity or other allowance, provided that —

(a) the officer retires in circumstances in which he would otherwise be eligible for a person; and

(b) for the purposes of these Regulations he shall be deemed to hold and to have held, during the period of such seconded service, a pensionable office to which are attached pensionable emoluments equal to those of the pensionable office from which he was seconded.

Emoluments on which pensions to be computed

13.—(1) Pensions and gratuities shall be computed —

(a) where an officer has held one office, the pensionable emoluments of which are not based on a scale of increments, for a period of not less than 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement, on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at that date in respect of that office;

(b) where an officer has at any time during such period of 3 years been transferred from one such office to another, but his pensionable emoluments have not been changed by reason of such transfer or transfers on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at the date of his retirement in respect of the office then held by him;

(c) where an officer has held an office or has served as an officer of a class, the pensionable emoluments of which are based on a scale of increments, for a period of not less than 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement, on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at that date in respect of that office or as an officer of that class:

Provided that where two or more classes are subject to one time scale, they shall be treated for this purpose as one class;

(d) in all other cases, on the average amount of the pensionable emoluments payable to the officer during a period of 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement:

Provided that —

(i) in the case of an officer who has received promotion within 3 years of the date of his retirement any services in an office or class of office in which such officer served within the said 3 years shall, for the purposes of computation under this regulation, be deemed to be service on the highest pensionable emoluments paid to such officer in that office or class;

(ii) in the case of an officer who has received promotion within 3 years of the date of his retirement his pension may be calculated as if he had not been so promoted if this should be to his advantage.

(2) Pensions and gratuities computed under this regulation shall, where applicable, be computed subject to the following conditions:

(a) that where the pensionable emoluments attached to the posts held by an officer during the 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement have been increased at any time during that period, the pension or gratuity shall be computed on one-third (1/3rd) of the aggregate increased pensionable emoluments attached to those posts, as if the increased pensionable emoluments had been in force and payable during the whole of the said period;

(b) that in the case of an officer who has less than 3 years pensionable service, the pension or gratuity shall be computed on the average amount of the pensionable emoluments payable to the officer during his pensionable service;

(c) that where the pensionable emoluments attached to the post held by an officer at the date of his retirement have been reduced for misconduct the pension or gratuity shall be computed on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at that date or on the average amount of the pensionable emoluments payable to the officer during a period of 3 years immediately preceding that date, whichever shall be the less.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) —

(a) any gratuity to be granted under section 16 of the Act in respect of an officer who dies in the public service shall be computed on the basis of the pensionable emoluments payable to him on the date of his death;

(b) any pension or gratuity to be granted to an officer in the public service under section 7(2)(c) of the Act in circumstances where that officer would be eligible for any benefit under regulation 18 or 20 shall be computed on the basis of the pensionable emoluments payable to him immediately preceding the date of his retirement.

Pensions granted for whole-time and part-time service

14.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), no pension, allowance or gratuity shall be granted under these Regulations to any officer whose whole-time is not given to the public service.

(2) Part-time service shall qualify as pensionable service but it shall be counted on the basis of the proportion the part-time service bears to whole-time service over the same period.

[S 484/1989 wef 15/12/1989]

Gratuity and reduced pension

15.—(1) Subject to this regulation, an officer to whom a pension is granted under the Act may —

(a) in the case of an officer retiring before 7th December 1984, be paid a reduced pension at the rate of 3/4ths of such pension together with a commuted pension gratuity equal to 12½ times the annual value of the reduction so made in the pension;

(b) in the case of an officer retiring on or after 7th December 1984, be paid a reduced pension together with a commuted pension gratuity of an amount equal to 1/120th of his one year’s pensionable emoluments in respect of each complete month of pensionable service subject to a maximum of his pensionable emoluments for 3 years.

[S 318/84]

(2) The reduced pension to be granted under paragraph (1) (b) shall be the amount of his annual pension less 2/25ths of the gratuity granted to him.

Restoration of full pension

(3) An officer who is paid a reduced pension under paragraph (1) shall, after the expiration of 12 years and 6 months from the date he is granted the reduced pension, be eligible for the full pension as if there had been no reduction.

Full pension

(4) An officer to whom a reduced pension together with a gratuity is granted under the Act may, at his option exercisable in accordance with this regulation, be paid in lieu of the reduced pension together with a gratuity the full pension without any gratuity.

(5) The option shall be exercisable, and if it has already been exercised may be revoked not later than the day immediately preceding the date of the officer’s retirement:

Provided that if the officer has not exercised the option prior to the day preceding the date of his retirement, the President may, if it appears in the circumstances equitable to do so, allow the officer to exercise the option at any time between that date and the date of award of a pension to him.

(6) If an officer who has exercised the option under paragraph (4) dies after he has finally retired but before a pension has been awarded to him, it shall be lawful for the President to grant a gratuity and a reduced pension, as if the officer before his death had not exercised the option.

Case of pensioner re-employed

16.—(1) If an officer to whom a pension has been granted under the Act is appointed to another office in the public service in Singapore, the payment of his pension may, if the President thinks fit, be suspended during the period of his re-employment.

(2) If an officer to whom a pension or a gratuity has been granted under the Act or under any written law repealed by the Act or, in respect of other public service, under the law or regulations applicable thereto, is appointed to another office in the public service in Singapore and subsequently retires in circumstances in which he may be granted a pension, he may be granted, in lieu of his previous pension or gratuity, a pension computed as if the periods of his service had been continuous, and such pension may be based on his pensionable emoluments at the date of his previous or his final retirement from the service of the Government, whichever are the greater:

Provided that in such a case —

(a) if on his previous retirement the officer was granted a gratuity and reduced pension, there shall be refunded to the Government the amount, if any, by which such gratuity together with the total amount of such reduced pension paid during the period of retirement exceeds the total amount of the pension at full pension rate which would have been payable during such period if the officer had not elected to receive gratuity and reduced pension;

(b) if on his previous retirement the officer was granted a gratuity only, there shall be refunded to the Government the amount, if any, by which such gratuity exceeds the total amount of the pension at the full pension rate which would have been payable during the period of retirement, if no regard had been had to the minimum period of service qualifying for a pension and the officer had been granted a pension in respect of the service on account of which the gratuity was granted.

Abolition or re-organisation of office

17.—(1) If an officer holding a pensionable office retires or be removed from the public service in consequence of the abolition of his office or for the purpose of facilitating improvement in the department in which he belongs by which greater efficiency or economy can be effected, he may be granted a pension at the rate of one five-hundredth (1/500th) of his annual pensionable emoluments in respect of each complete month of pensionable service until two-hundred-and-forty five-hundredths (240/500ths) is reached and one six-hundredth (1/600th) in respect of each complete month of pensionable service in excess of 240 months.

(2) No pension shall be granted under this regulation exceeding in amount the pension for which the officer would have been eligible under regulation 5 if he had continued to hold his office until he reached the age at which he might be required to retire, or the maximum prescribed in section 10 of the Act.

(3) The grant of any pension under this regulation shall be subject to the condition that the officer shall be liable to be recalled for service in Singapore:

Provided that if such officer is not qualified for other employment in the service of Singapore or if there is no reason in the opinion of the President to expect that he can shortly be re-employed a pension may be granted to him free from the abovementioned condition.

[18

Allowance for injured officers

18.—(1) Where a person other than a police officer employed in the public service of the Government, whether serving in a pensionable or non-pensionable office —

(a) has been permanently injured in the actual discharge of his duty, without his own fault, by some injury specifically attributable to the nature of his duty;

(b) has been permanently injured in special circumstances which, in the opinion of the President, justify exceptional treatment; or

(c) contracts a disease to which he is specifically exposed by the nature of his duty, not being a disease wholly or mainly due to or seriously aggravated by his own serious and culpable negligence or misconduct,

and his retirement, on the recommendation of a medical board or of a medical practitioner approved by the President, is thereby necessitated or materially accelerated, he may be granted in respect of such injury or disease, in addition to any pension, gratuity or other allowance granted under these Regulations, an annual allowance at the rate of the proportion of his emoluments at the date of his injury or contraction of the disease, as shown in the following table:

Where his capacity to contribute to his support is —

(b) where the person so injured or suffering from ill-health or disease is —

(4) An officer so injured or suffering from ill-health or disease who is not qualified for either a pension under regulation 5 or a gratuity under regulation 24 may nevertheless be granted a pension of the same amount as the additional allowance which he might have been granted if he had been so qualified.

(5) Where it appears that the person so injured would, but for this paragraph, in respect of the same injury, both be entitled to compensation under any written law relating to workmen’s compensation for the time being in force in Singapore and be eligible to receive an allowance under this regulation, he shall be required to elect whether he will receive compensation under the said written law or an allowance under this regulation. If such person elects to receive compensation under the said written law he shall receive no allowance under this regulation.

(6) Where the person so injured, having elected to receive an allowance under this regulation and having been granted such allowance, subsequently institutes proceedings under the said written law for compensation in respect of the same injury on account of which such allowance was granted, such allowance may be cancelled at any time.

(7) If an officer proceeding by a route approved by the Minister to or from Singapore at the commencement or termination of his service therein or of a period of leave therefrom, is permanently injured as the result of damage to the vessel, aircraft or vehicle in which he is travelling or of any act of violence directed against himself or against such vessel, aircraft or vehicle, and the President is satisfied that such damage or act is attributable to circumstances arising out of a war in which Singapore may be engaged, such officer shall be deemed, for the purposes of this regulation, to have been injured in the circumstances described in paragraph (1).

Where his capacity to contribute to his support is —

(8) (a) Where an officer is permanently injured as a result of an accident occurring to any aircraft in which he is being carried in pursuance of official instructions, he shall be deemed for the purposes of this regulation to have been injured in the actual discharge of his duty and by some injury specifically attributable to the nature of his duty.

(b) Where an allowance may be granted in accordance with paragraph (1) when read in conjunction with sub-paragraph (a) to any person to whom sub-paragraph (a) may apply, the following table shall be substituted for that appearing in paragraph (1):

(a) in the actual discharge of his duty;

(b) without his own default; and

(c) on account of circumstances specifically attributable to the nature of his duty,

while in the public service in Singapore, whether serving in a pensionable or non-pensionable office, it shall be lawful for the President to grant, in addition to the gratuity, if any, granted in accordance with section 16 of the Act —

(i) if the deceased officer leaves a widow, a pension to her, while unmarried and of good character, at a rate not exceeding ten-sixtieths (10/60ths) of his annual pensionable emoluments at the date of the injury or $240 a year, whichever is the greater;

(ii) if the deceased officer leaves a widow to whom a pension is granted under sub-paragraph (i) and a child or children, a pension in respect of each child, until such child attains the age of 18 years, of an amount not exceeding one-thirtieth (1/30th) of his annual pensionable emoluments but not less than $60 a year;

(5) When an officer dies as a result of injuries received in an accident occurring to any aircraft in which he is being carried in pursuance of official instructions, as defined in regulation 18 (8) (c), he shall be deemed to have died as a result of injuries received in the actual discharge of his duty and on account of circumstances specifically attributable to the nature of his duty, and in calculating any pension payable under this regulation in respect of such officer paragraph (1) (i) shall be read as if the words “fifteen-sixtieths (15/60ths)” had been substituted for the words “ten-sixtieths (10/60ths)” appearing therein and sub-paragraph (ii) of the said paragraph as if the words “one-sixth (1/6th)” had been substituted for the words “one-thirtieth (1/30th)” appearing therein.

(6) This regulation, other than paragraph (5), shall be deemed to have come into operation on 3rd September 1939.

(7) Where an officer other than a police officer —

(a) sustains a partial disablement or total disablement from an injury; or

(a) a sum equivalent to the amount calculated under the Workmen’s Compensation Act as if he was a workman under that Act; or

(b) a sum equivalent to the gratuity computed under section 16 of the Act as if he had died from the injury,

whichever is the greater.

[S 236/86]

Provided that no such capital sum shall be paid to any officer who elects to receive a gratuity and a reduced annual allowance in accordance with paragraph (3).

(3) Regulation 15 shall apply to an annual allowance granted under paragraph (1), and in its application thereto references to “pension” in that regulation shall be read as references to “annual allowance”, except that the reduced annual allowance to be granted to an officer shall be at the rate of three-fourths (3/4ths) of his annual allowance and his commuted annual allowance gratuity shall be equal to 12½ times the annual value of the reduction so made in his allowance.
