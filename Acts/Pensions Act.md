[7/97]

(4) Moneys applied under subsection (3) for the discharge of the debts of the officer or pensioner referred to in that subsection shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be regarded as applied for his benefit.

(5) When a person to whom a pension or allowance has not been granted or whose pension or allowance has ceased under this section obtains a full and proper discharge from his bankruptcy or insolvency, his pension or allowance shall be restored to him with effect from the date of such discharge.

[6

Service to be unbroken

(a) the service has been interrupted by abolition of office or other temporary suspension of employment not arising from misconduct or voluntary resignation; or

(b) the break in service is caused by retirement under the provisions of the Instruction Manual for the time being in force on the election of an officer as a Member of Parliament or of any local government authority.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an officer —

(b) who has retired from the public service without pension on account of ill-health, abolition of office or re-organisation designed to effect greater efficiency and economy, and has subsequently been re-employed in the public service,

(i) any pension previously granted to him in respect of his service under the Government; and

(ii) any gratuity so granted which is required to be refunded as a condition of the application to the officer of this paragraph,

but in addition to any gratuity so granted which is not required to be refunded.

[7

Acting service

7. Where an officer has performed acting service in a pensionable office under the Government, the period of such service may be taken into account as pensionable service if the period of such acting service —

(c) any period during which an officer on the pensionable establishment has served on duty in Malaya or in Brunei Darussalam, whether in a pensionable office or not, may be regarded as pensionable service; and

[9

9. Any period during which an officer absent on leave from Singapore has, with the consent of the President, served with the Singapore Armed Forces or in any capacity connected with a state of war, may be reckoned as service on full pay for the purposes of these Regulations.

[11

Officers seconded to public body

11. Where an officer has been seconded from a pensionable office to an office or class of office which is not pensionable or to service under a public body, the period of such temporary employment shall be reckoned for the purpose of pension, gratuity or other allowance, provided that —

(a) the officer retires in circumstances in which he would otherwise be eligible for a pension; and

(b) for the purposes of these Regulations he shall be deemed to hold and to have held, during the period of such seconded service, a pensionable office to which are attached pensionable emoluments equal to those of the pensionable office from which he was seconded.

[12

Emoluments on which pensions to be computed

12.—(1) Pensions and gratuities shall be computed —

(a) where an officer has held one office, the pensionable emoluments of which are not based on a scale of increments, for a period of not less than 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement, on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at that date in respect of that office;

(b) where an officer has at any time during such period of 3 years been transferred from one such office to another, but his pensionable emoluments have not been changed by reason of such transfer or transfers on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at the date of his retirement in respect of the office then held by him;

(c) where an officer has held an office or has served as an officer of a class, the pensionable emoluments of which are based on a scale of increments, for a period of not less than 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement, on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at that date in respect of that office or as an officer of that class, except that where 2 or more classes are subject to one time scale, they shall be treated for this purpose as one class; and

(d) in all other cases, on the average amount of the pensionable emoluments payable to the officer during a period of 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement, except that —

(i) in the case of an officer who has received promotion within 3 years of the date of his retirement, any services in an office or class of office in which such officer served within those 3 years shall, for the purposes of computation under this regulation, be deemed to be service on the highest pensionable emoluments paid to the officer in that office or class; and

(ii) in the case of an officer who has received promotion within 3 years of the date of his retirement, his pension may be calculated as if he had not been so promoted if this should be to his advantage.

(2) Pensions and gratuities computed under this regulation shall, where applicable, be computed subject to the following conditions:

(a) that where the pensionable emoluments attached to the posts held by an officer during the 3 years immediately preceding the date of his retirement have been increased at any time during that period, the pension or gratuity shall be computed on one-third (⅓rd) of the aggregate increased pensionable emoluments attached to those posts, as if the increased pensionable emoluments had been in force and payable during the whole of such period;

(b) that in the case of an officer who has less than 3 years’ pensionable service, the pension or gratuity shall be computed on the average amount of the pensionable emoluments payable to the officer during his pensionable service;

(c) that where the pensionable emoluments attached to the post held by an officer at the date of his retirement have been reduced for misconduct, the pension or gratuity shall be computed on the pensionable emoluments payable to him at that date or on the average amount of the pensionable emoluments payable to the officer during a period of 3 years immediately preceding that date, whichever is the less.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) —

(a) any gratuity to be granted under section 20 of the Act in respect of an officer who dies in the public service shall be computed on the basis of the pensionable emoluments payable to him on the date of his death; and

(b) any pension or gratuity to be granted to an officer in the public service under section 11(2)(c) of the Act in circumstances where that officer would be eligible for any benefit under regulation 20 or 22 shall be computed on the basis of the pensionable emoluments payable to him immediately preceding the date of his retirement.

13.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), no pension, gratuity or other allowance shall be granted under these Regulations to any officer whose whole-time is not given to the public service.

(b) has been permanently injured in special circumstances which, in the opinion of the relevant Pension Authority, justify exceptional treatment; or

(c) contracts a disease to which he is specifically exposed by the nature of his duty, not being a disease wholly or mainly due to or seriously aggravated by his own serious and culpable negligence or misconduct,

and his retirement, on the recommendation of a medical board or of a medical practitioner approved by the relevant Pension Authority, is thereby necessitated or materially accelerated, he may be granted in respect of such injury or disease, in addition to any pension, gratuity or other allowance granted under these Regulations, an annual allowance at the rate of the proportion of his emoluments at the date of his injury or contraction of the disease, as shown in the following table:

(3) The amount of the annual allowance shall be reduced to such an extent as the relevant Pension Authority shall think reasonable in the following cases:

(a) where the person so injured or suffering from ill-health or disease has continued to serve for not less than one year after such injury, or after contracting such ill-health or disease in respect of which he retires;

(b) where the person so injured or suffering from ill-health or disease is —

(i) in the case of officers in the public service in Singapore on 1st July 1956, not less than 50 years old at the date of such injury, or contraction of such ill-health or disease; and

(ii) in the case of other officers not less than 45 years old at the date of such injury, or contraction of such ill-health or disease; or

(c) where such injury, ill-health or disease is not the sole cause of retirement, but the retirement is caused partly by age or infirmity not due to such injury, ill-health or disease.
