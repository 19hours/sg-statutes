### Payment to meet further costs, etc.

(2) In either case there shall also be paid into court such additional amount as the court considers will be sufficient to meet the contingency of further costs, expenses and interest, and any other contingency, except depreciation of investments, not exceeding one-tenth part of the original amount to be paid in, unless the court for special reason thinks fit to require a larger additional amount.

### Declaration of freedom from incumbrance

(3) Thereupon, the court may, if it thinks fit, and either after or without any notice to the incumbrancer, as the court thinks fit, declare that land to be freed from the incumbrance, and make any order for conveyance, or vesting order, proper for giving effect to the sale, and give directions for the retention and investment of the money in court.

### Payment or transfer

the order may be enforced and so long as the order remains unreversed the lessee shall be barred from all relief.

(9) Where the court extends a period under subsection (4) at a time when —

(a) that period has expired; and

(b) a writ of possession in respect of the property has been issued,

the court shall suspend the writ for the extended period, and if, before the expiration of the extended period, the lessee pays into court all the rent in arrear and the sum directed to be paid on account of the costs of the action, the court shall cancel the writ.

(10) Nothing in this section shall be taken to affect —
