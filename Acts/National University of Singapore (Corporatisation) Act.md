Part V Assurances and ASPFAIS Investments deemed investments under CPFIS

22\. On the dissolution date, every Part V Assurance and ASPFAIS Investment of a living relevant person who is not uncontactable held by him immediately before the dissolution date (other than any Part V Assurance or ASPFAIS Investment which that person has opted to be transferred or assigned to him under paragraph 5(b)) shall be deemed to be an investment made by him under the CPFIS, and all premiums paid or deemed to have been paid with ASPF moneys in respect of ASPFAIS Investments and Part V Assurances shall, on and after the dissolution date, be deemed to have been paid with CPF moneys from his CPF account.

23\. Every living relevant person who, immediately before the date of the dissolution notice and continuously up to the date immediately before the dissolution date, used ASPF moneys for the purpose of paying the premium on his Part V Assurance shall, on and after the dissolution date, be entitled to use moneys credited to his ordinary account with the CPF Board for the same purpose.

24\. For the avoidance of doubt, a living relevant person who, immediately before the dissolution date, did not use his ASPF moneys for the purpose of paying the premium on his Part V Assurance shall not be entitled to use moneys credited to his ordinary account with the CPF Board for such purpose.

Preservation of rights in relation to immovable property

25.—(1) Each mortgage (whether legal or equitable) in favour of the university company in relation to any mortgaged property under the ASPF Scheme of a living relevant person who is not uncontactable shall, on the dissolution date, be transferred to and vest in the CPF Board.

(2) The CPF Board shall, in respect of any mortgage referred to in sub-paragraph (1) and the liabilities thereby secured, be entitled to the same rights and priorities and subject to the same obligations and incidents on and after the dissolution date as the university company would have been entitled and subject to if the mortgage had continued to be held by the university company or in the university company’s favour.

26\. Notwithstanding section 145 of the Land Titles Act (Cap. 157), it shall not be necessary for the CPF Board to make any application to the Registrar of Titles to enter in the land-register a memorial of the vesting in favour of the CPF Board of all mortgages or charges of registered land transferred to and vested in the CPF Board under paragraph 25(1).

27\. Section 56(1) of the Land Titles Act shall not apply to any instrument executed by the CPF Board purporting to dispose of, or to create an interest in, mortgages or charges of registered land transferred to or vested in the CPF Board under paragraph 25(1) and shall not prevent the registration of any such instrument executed by the CPF Board, notwithstanding that the CPF Board may not be named as the proprietor of the registered land in the land-register at the time of the registration of such instrument.

28\. Notwithstanding section 4 of the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap. 269), it shall not be necessary for the CPF Board to register the transfer to or vesting in favour of the CPF Board of all mortgages or charges of unregistered land under paragraph 25(1), and the production of a Government Printer’s copy of this Act and such evidence of publication of the dissolution date in the Gazette shall be admissible in any court as evidence of the CPF Board’s interest in such land.

29\. For the purposes of the Land Titles Act and the Registration of Deeds Act, all caveats or memoranda of charge claiming an interest in land as mortgagee or chargee in respect of any mortgaged property under the ASPF Scheme lodged by the university company and subsisting as at the dissolution date shall be construed and have effect on and after that date as if for any reference therein to the university company were substituted with a reference to the CPF Board.
