3\.—(1) No innkeeper shall be liable to make good to his guest any loss of or injury to goods or property brought to his inn, not being a horse or other live animal, or any gear appertaining thereto or any car or carriage, to a greater amount than the sum of $500, except —

(a) where the goods or property have been stolen, lost or injured through the wilful act, default or neglect of the innkeeper or any servant in his employ; or

(b) where the goods or property have been deposited expressly for safe custody with the innkeeper or his manager.

(2) In the case of any such deposit it shall be lawful for the innkeeper or his manager, if he thinks fit, to require, as a condition of his liability —

(a) that the guest shall at the time of such deposit declare the value of the goods or property; and

(b) that the goods or property shall be deposited in a box or other receptacle, fastened and sealed by the person depositing the same.

(3) An innkeeper or his manager may refuse to receive for safe custody under this section goods or property of any one guest the declared value of which exceeds $5,000, and shall in no case be liable for loss of or injury to goods or property so deposited by a guest to an amount exceeding the declared value thereof.

### Refusal to accept property for safe custody

4\. If any innkeeper or his manager refuses to receive for safe custody, as before mentioned, any goods or property of his guest the declared value of which does not exceed $5,000, or if any such guest is unable, through any default of the innkeeper or manager, to deposit the goods or property as aforesaid, the innkeeper shall not be entitled to the benefit of this Part in respect of the goods or property.
