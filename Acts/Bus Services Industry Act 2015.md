## PART 2

BUS SERVICES PROCUREMENT FRAMEWORK

### Public bus services contracts

6\.—(1) The LTA may enter into a public bus services contract with any person for the provision of one or more regular route services.

(2) In particular, the LTA may enter into a public bus services contract for the provision of one or more regular route services under subsection (1) with a person that is subject to a condition precedent that requires that person to obtain a bus service licence for that regular route service or services, as the case may be.

(3) The LTA may invite public bus service contracts by tender or in any other manner it thinks fit.

### Contents of public bus services contracts

7\.—(1) A public bus services contract may relate to a particular area in Singapore or route wholly or partly within Singapore.

(2) However, a public bus services contract must —

(a) specify the term of the contract;

(b) provide the manner in which the public bus operator who is party to the contract will be remunerated or gain revenue from the provision of the regular route service or services under the contract; and

(c) specify the performance standards to be met by the public bus operator who is party to the contract in relation to the provision of regular route services under the contract.

(3) A public bus services contract may make provision in relation to the operation of any regular route service under the contract and the administration of the contract, including, but is not limited to —

(a) the variation of the contract, such as —

(i) to extend the service into developing areas in Singapore;

(ii) for public safety;

(iii) because of changed traffic conditions;

(iv) to improve that regular route service in the public interest;

(v) to address a serious or frequent failure on the part of the public bus operator under the contract to observe the terms and conditions of the contract; or

(vi) to address the public bus operator under the contract having been found guilty of an offence under this Act committed during the term of the contract;

(b) the fees (if any) payable under the contract;

(4) Subsection (3) does not limit the matters about which a public bus services contract may make provision.

### Enforcement of performance standards in public bus services contracts

8\.—(1) Performance standards provided for by a public bus services contract are to be enforced by penalty provisions or in any other manner that the contract may provide.

(2) A person —

(a) who breaches a public bus services contract;

(b) who fails (being not a breach of contract) to meet a requirement specified in a public bus services contract; or

(c) who terminates a public bus services contract,

that is enforceable by a penalty provision is liable to pay, as a debt due to the LTA, an amount determined in accordance with the contract as the penalty for the breach, failure or termination, as the case may be.

(3) A public bus services contract may provide that an amount payable under a penalty provision may also be recovered by withholding amounts otherwise payable under the contract and may contain other related provisions.

(4) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not limit the provisions of a public bus services contract that may be enforced by penalty provisions.

(5) This section has effect despite any rule of, or principle at, common law.

### Offer of further public bus services contract

9\.—(1) The LTA may enter into a further public bus services contract with a licensed bus operator on, before or after the expiry of the term of a public bus services contract with that bus operator only if the LTA decides that that operator’s performance under the public bus services contract (called in this section an existing public bus services contract) has been satisfactory.

(2) However, a further contract may be on the same or different terms.

(3) This section does not apply to an existing public bus services contract in relation to which an option to renew may be exercised under the contract, or an interim services contract.

(4) To avoid doubt, nothing in this Part confers a right to or expectation of a further public bus services contract.

### Termination of public bus services contracts

10\.—(1) A public bus services contract is automatically terminated if —

(a) the public bus operator that is party to a contract with a condition precedent referred to in section 6(2) ceases to hold the bus service licence for the regular route service or services specified in the contract; or

(b) the operator contravenes section 17.

(ii) a renewal fee or late renewal fee (if prescribed), renew the licence; or

(b) refuse to grant or renew the bus service licence, as the case may be.

(2) In deciding whether an applicant should be granted a Class 1 bus service licence, or the applicant’s Class 1 bus service licence should be renewed, and the conditions to impose or modify, the LTA must have regard to, and give such weight as the LTA considers appropriate to, all of the following matters:

(i) every member of the board of directors or committee or board of trustees or other governing body of an applicant which is a company, limited liability partnership or other body corporate; or

(ii) every partner of an applicant that is a partnership,

is a suitable person to be involved in the management or operation of the regular route services in the application;

(g) whether it is otherwise contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted to the applicant.

(3) For the purpose of determining whether or not a person referred to in subsection (2)(f) is a suitable person to be involved in the management or operation of 10 or more regular route services, the LTA must, having regard to the degree and nature of the person’s proposed involvement in the public bus system in Singapore, have regard to, and give such weight as the LTA considers appropriate to, all of the following matters:

(a) the person’s relevant knowledge, competency and experience;

(b) any evidence of the exercise of any power under section 39 in relation to the person —

(i) for committing an offence under this Act; or

(c) any conviction for committing —

(ii) any other offence, whether or not the conviction was in a Singapore court and whether or not the offence was committed before the date of commencement of this Part.

(4) In determining whether an applicant should be granted a Class 2 bus service licence, or whether the applicant’s Class 2 bus service licence should be renewed, and the conditions to impose or modify, the LTA must have regard to, and give such weight as the LTA considers appropriate to, all of the following matters:

(e) whether it is otherwise contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted to the applicant.

(5) To avoid doubt, the LTA is not confined to consideration of the matters specified in subsection (2), (3) or (4) and may take into account such other matters and evidence as may be relevant.

(6) Without prejudice to subsection (1), the LTA may grant a renewal of a bus service licence (of any class) with or without modifying the conditions of the licence, but section 16 does not apply to or in relation to granting a renewal of a bus service licence with modifications to the conditions of the licence.

### Validity of bus service licences

14\.—(1) Every bus service licence must state its class and be in such form as the LTA may determine.

(2) Every bus service licence granted or renewed under this Part is to continue in force for such period as may be specified in the licence unless it is earlier revoked or suspended under section 39.
