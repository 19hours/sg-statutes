(9) An order under subsection (8) shall take effect from the time the order is made.

(10) While any order of suspension from practice made under subsection (2)(b) remains in force, the person to whom the order applies shall not for the purposes of this Act be regarded as having in force a practising certificate but immediately on the expiry or annulment of such order, his privileges under this Act shall be revived as from the date of expiry or annulment.
