## PART II

WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION FOR INJURY

### Employer’s liability for compensation

3\.—(1) If in any employment personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

(2) An accident happening to a workman while he is, with the express or implied permission of his employer, travelling as a passenger by any means of transport to or from his place of work shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of his employment if at the time of the accident the means of transport is being operated by or on behalf of his employer or by some other person by whom it is operated in pursuance of arrangements made with his employer and is not being operated in the ordinary course of a public transport service.

(3) An accident happening to a workman in or about any premises at which he is for the time being employed for the purposes of his employer’s trade or business shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of his employment if it happens while he is taking steps, on an actual or supposed emergency at those premises, to rescue or protect persons who are, or are thought to be or possibly to be injured or imperilled, or to avert or minimise damage or loss to property.

(4) An accident happening to a workman shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of his employment notwithstanding that he was at the time of the accident acting in contravention of any written law or other regulations applicable to his employment, or of any orders given by or on behalf of his employer, or that he was acting without instructions from his employer, if —

(a) the accident would have been deemed so to have arisen had such act not been done in contravention as aforesaid or without instructions from his employer, as the case may be; and

(b) such act was done for the purposes of and in connection with the employer’s trade or business.

(5) An employer shall not be liable to pay compensation in respect of —

(a) any injury to a workman resulting from an accident if it is proved that the injury to the workman is directly attributable to the workman having been at the time thereof under the influence of alcohol or a drug not prescribed by a medical practitioner unless the injury results in the death or permanent incapacity causing a loss of not less than 50% of the earning capacity of the workman; or

(b) any incapacity or death resulting from a deliberate self-injury or the deliberate aggravation of an accidental injury.

(6) For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of a workman’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.

### Compensation for occupational diseases

4\.—(1) If a workman who is employed in any occupation specified in the Second Schedule contracts a disease shown in that Schedule to be related to that occupation, or if a workman who has been employed in that occupation contracts that disease within 12 months, or in the case of silicosis or asbestosis within 36 months, after ceasing to be so employed, and if incapacity or the death of the workman results from that disease, compensation shall be payable as if the disease were a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of that employment, and all the other provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly, subject to this section.

(2) When a workman enters into a contract of service or apprenticeship with any employer to work in any occupation specified in the Second Schedule or is, with his consent, transferred by his employer to such an occupation, he shall, if requested to do so by the employer, submit himself for examination by a medical practitioner, the fee for which shall be paid by the employer; but he shall not be required to submit himself for such examination otherwise than in accordance with regulations made under this Act.

(3) No compensation shall be payable by an employer under this section in respect of the incapacity or death of a workman if the incapacity begins or the death happens more than 12 months, or in the case of silicosis or asbestosis more than 36 months, after the workman has ceased to be employed in his employment:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to the death of a workman where his death has been preceded, whether immediately or not, by any period of incapacity in respect of which compensation is payable under this section.

(4) For the purposes of calculating the monthly earnings of the workman in a claim for compensation under this section, the date of commencement of the incapacity of the workman or the date of his death, if there has been no previous period of incapacity, shall be treated as the date of the happening of the accident, if he is then employed by the employer from whom compensation is claimed in any employment to the nature of which the disease is due, and if he is not then so employed, the last day on which he was so employed shall for this purpose be deemed to be the date of the happening of the accident.

(5) For all other purposes of this Act, the date of commencement of the incapacity of the workman, or the date on which a medical practitioner certifies that in his opinion the workman is suffering from such disease, whichever date is the earlier, or the date of his death if there has been no previous period of incapacity shall be deemed to be the date of the happening of the accident.

(6) If the disease has been contracted by a gradual process, so that two or more employers are severally liable to pay compensation in respect thereof under this section, the aggregate amount of such compensation shall not exceed the amount that would have been payable if those employers had been a single employer, and in such case each of those employers shall, in default of agreement, be liable for such proportion of the compensation payable as the Commissioner thinks just.

(7) The Minister may appoint such medical practitioners to be medical referees for the purpose of determining whether the disease in respect of which compensation is claimed is in fact a disease specified in the Second Schedule and any other matter which is material for the determination of any claim for compensation under this Act.

(8) The report of a medical referee appointed under subsection (7) may be acted upon by the Commissioner as if it were conclusive evidence of the facts certified in such report.

### Compensation limited to injuries received at work

5\. Except as provided in sections 3 and 4, no compensation shall be payable to a workman in respect of any disease unless the disease is directly attributable to a specific injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the relevant employment.

### Persons entitled to compensation

6\.—(1) The compensation shall be payable to or for the benefit of the workman, or, where death results from the injury, to or for the benefit of his dependants as provided by this Act.

(2) Where a dependant dies before a claim under this Act is determined by the Commissioner, the legal personal representative of the dependant shall have no right to payment of compensation, and the amount of compensation shall be calculated and apportioned as if that dependant had died before the workman.

(3) Where a deceased workman has no dependants the compensation shall be paid into a fund to be known as the Worker’s Fund which shall be established, maintained and applied in accordance with regulations made under this Act and the person managing the Fund shall be entitled to claim the compensation.

### Amount of compensation

7\. Subject to the provisions of this Act, the amount of compensation payable shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Third Schedule.

### Method of calculating earnings

8\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, the earnings of a workman shall be computed in such manner as is best calculated to give his true monthly earnings at the date of the accident, subject to the following provisions:

(a) where the workman has been exclusively employed by the employer who is liable to pay compensation during a continuous period of 12 months or any shorter period immediately preceding the accident, his monthly earnings shall be deemed to be the average amount of his earnings during those 12 months or shorter period, as the case may be;

(b) where the workman has been exclusively employed by the employer for any period which is less than a month, his monthly earnings shall be deemed to be the earnings he would have received for the whole month;

[Subst. by Act 16/90 wef 01/09/1990]

(c) where reliable evidence of the earnings of the relevant workman under paragraph (a) or (b) does not exist or cannot be adduced without undue delay or expense, regard may be had to evidence of the earnings of workmen employed on similar work in the same locality at or about the date of the accident.

[Deleted by Act 16/90 wef 01/09/1990]

(2) Where a workman is employed in the same occupation under contracts of service with two or more employers under which he worked at one time for one such employer and at another time for another such employer, his monthly earnings shall be computed as if his earnings under all such contracts were earnings in the employment of the employer for whom he was working at the time of the accident.

(3) For the purposes of this section, a period of service shall be deemed to be continuous if it has not been interrupted by a period of absence from work exceeding 14 days.

### Distribution of compensation

9\.—(1) No payment of compensation in respect of a workman whose injury has resulted in death or permanent incapacity shall be made otherwise than by deposit with the Commissioner, and any such payment made directly to the workman or his dependant shall be deemed not to be payment of compensation for the purposes of this Act:

Provided that the Commissioner may —

(a) authorise payment of compensation to be made directly to a workman who is not less than 18 years of age in respect of injury resulting in permanent partial incapacity;

(b) take into account any amount paid otherwise than in accordance with this subsection in assessing the compensation payable under this Act if he considers it fair and reasonable to do so.

(2) The receipt of the Commissioner shall be a sufficient discharge for any compensation deposited with him.

(3) On the deposit of any money under subsection (1) as compensation in respect of an accident resulting in the death of a workman, the Commissioner may deduct therefrom the actual amount of the expenses of the funeral of the workman or $250, whichever is the less, and may pay the same to the person by whom such expenses were incurred.

(4) Compensation deposited in respect of an accident resulting in the death of a workman shall be apportioned among the dependants of the deceased workman in such proportion as the Commissioner thinks fit, or may, in the discretion of the Commissioner, be allotted to any one dependant.

(5)(a) Where any lump sum deposited with the Commissioner is payable to a person who is under any legal disability or in any other case where the Commissioner considers it desirable to do so, the Commissioner may in his discretion order such sum to be invested, applied or otherwise dealt with for the benefit of that person in such manner and for such period as the Commissioner may determine.

(b)

Where a monthly payment is payable to any workman under a legal disability the Commissioner may, of his own motion or on application made to him in that behalf, order that the payment be made during the disability to any dependant of the workman or to any other person whom the Commissioner thinks best fitted to provide for the welfare of the workman.

[Act 16/90 wef 01/09/1990]

(6) If the Commissioner is satisfied after such inquiry as he may consider necessary that no dependant of a deceased workman exists or can be traced and the circumstances are such that there is no reasonable likelihood that any dependant can be traced he shall pay the balance of the money deposited with him under subsection (1) to the Workers’ Fund.

(7) Where after inquiry made of his own motion or on application made to him the Commissioner is satisfied that by reason of any change in the circumstances of any dependant, or for any other sufficient cause, an order of the Commissioner made under this section ought to be varied, the Commissioner may make such order for the variation of that order as he thinks just in the circumstances of the case:

Provided that no such order prejudicial to any person shall be made unless that person has been given an opportunity of showing cause why the order should not be made, and no such order shall require the repayment by a dependant of any sum already paid to him except where such payment has been obtained by fraud or other improper means.

### Compensation not to be assigned, attached or charged

10\. Subject to the provisions of this Act, no lump sum or monthly payment payable under this Act shall in any way be capable of being assigned or charged or be liable to attachment or pass to any person other than the workman by operation of law nor shall any claim be set off against the same.

[Act 16/90]

### Notice and claim

11\.—(1) Except as provided in this section, proceedings for the recovery of compensation for an injury under this Act shall not be maintainable unless notice of the accident has been given to the employer by or on behalf of the workman as soon as practicable after the happening thereof and unless a claim for compensation with respect to that accident has been made within one year from the happening of the accident causing the injury, or, in the case of death, within one year from the date of the death.

(2) No notice to the employer shall be necessary where a fatal accident has occurred.

(3) The want of or any defect or inaccuracy in a notice shall not be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings if the employer is proved to have had knowledge of the accident from any other source at or about the time of the accident, or if it is found in the proceedings for settling the claim that the employer is not, or would not be, if a notice or amended notice were then given and the hearing postponed, prejudiced in his defence by the want, defect or inaccuracy, or that such want, defect or inaccuracy was occasioned by mistake, absence from Singapore or other reasonable cause.

(4) The failure to make a claim within the period specified in subsection (1) shall not be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings if it is found that the failure was occasioned by mistake, absence from Singapore or other reasonable cause.

(5) Notice to the employer (or, if there is more than one employer, to one of such employers) in respect of an injury may be given either in writing or orally or to the foreman or other person under whose supervision the workman was employed, or to any person designated for the purpose by the employer, and shall state in ordinary language the cause of the injury and the date on which and the place at which the accident happened.

(6) The notice if in writing may be given by delivering the notice at, or sending it by registered post addressed to, the residence or place of business of the person to whom it is to be given.

[34/80]

### Notice to Commissioner and insurer by employer

12\.—(1) Every employer shall give notice to the Commissioner in the prescribed form and to his insurer in writing of the occurrence of any accident as follows:

(a) where the accident results in death, within 10 days of its occurrence;

(b) where the accident results in any incapacity that renders the workman unfit for work for more than 14 days, within 18 days of its occurrence; and

(c) where the accident results in any incapacity that renders the workman unfit for work for 14 days or less, not later than the 15th day of the month following its occurrence.

(2) Any employer who fails to give notice as required by this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000.

[Act 16/90]

(3) For the purposes of this section, “employer” shall include the person, if any, referred to in section 17 as the principal.

[Subst. by Act 16/90 wef 01/09/1990]

### Medical examination and treatment

13\.—(1) When notice of an accident has been given to an employer by a workman or on his behalf, the employer shall, before the expiry of 5 days from the time at which service of the notice has been given, offer to have the workman examined free of charge by a medical practitioner and shall pay the cost of any medical treatment and medicines for the workman as the medical practitioner considers necessary, and the workman shall submit himself for such examination; and any workman who is in receipt of a monthly payment under this Act shall, if required by the employer, submit himself for such examination from time to time:

Provided that a workman shall not be required to submit himself for examination otherwise than in accordance with regulations made under this Act.

[Act 16/90]

(2) When medical reports are required for the purpose of this Act, the fees for such reports shall be paid by the employer.

(3) If a workman, on being required to do so by the employer under subsection (1) or by the Commissioner, at any time fails to submit himself for examination by a medical practitioner, his right to compensation shall be suspended until the examination has taken place; and if the failure extends over a period of 6 months from the date when the workman was required to submit himself for examination by the Commissioner, no compensation shall be payable in respect of any injury to the workman resulting from the accident unless the injury results in the death of the workman or unless the Commissioner is satisfied that there was reasonable cause for the failure.

[34/80]

(4) If a workman having been so required, and before the expiry of the period within which he is liable under subsection (1) to submit himself for medical examination, voluntarily leaves, without having been so examined, the place at which he was residing at the time of the accident, his right to compensation shall be suspended until he notifies his employer of his new address and offers himself for such examination.

(5) Where a workman whose right to compensation has been suspended under subsection (3) or (4) dies without having submitted himself for medical examination as required by those subsections, the Commissioner may, if he thinks fit, direct the payment of compensation to the dependants of the deceased workman.

(6) Where under subsection (3) or (4) a right to compensation is suspended, no compensation shall be payable in respect of the period of suspension.

(7) Where an injured workman has refused to be treated by a medical practitioner or has failed to carry out or deliberately disregarded the instructions for his treatment, then —

(a) where the workman is in receipt of monthly payments under the provisions of this Act, the Commissioner may order the suspension of those monthly payments until the workman accepts such treatment or has carried out such instructions, and may further, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the duration of the workman’s incapacity has been prolonged by such refusal, failure or disregard, order those monthly payments to be restricted to such period, calculated from the date of injury, as the disability of the workman might reasonably have been expected to have lasted for, had he accepted treatment and followed instructions; or

[Act 16/90 wef 01/09/1990]

(b) where the workman has suffered permanent incapacity and the Commissioner is satisfied that the incapacity has been aggravated by such refusal, failure or disregard, the Commissioner may order that compensation be paid to the workman appropriate to such incapacity as he might reasonably have been expected to have suffered if he had been regularly treated by a medical practitioner.

### Approved hospitals

14\.—(1) The Minister shall from time to time by notification in theGazettedeclare which hospitals are approved hospitals for the purpose of this Act; and, where a medical practitioner certifies that it is necessary for an injured workman to receive treatment in an approved hospital, that workman may be admitted to an approved hospital.

(2) Where an injured workman is admitted to an approved hospital, the employer shall, in addition to the payment of compensation under this Act, be liable to pay directly to the hospital all fees and charges in respect of that workman and the costs of such medicines and artificial limbs and surgical appliances as are certified by the medical practitioner in charge of the approved hospital to be necessary and which are in fact supplied to that workman:

Provided that the Minister shall from time to time by notification in theGazetteprescribe the maximum amounts for which an employer shall be liable in respect of the fees and costs specified in this subsection.

(3) If the injured workman refuses treatment at an approved hospital and the treatment is certified by a medical practitioner to be necessary, any order of compensation made to him may, at the instance of the employer, be suspended or reviewed by the Commissioner.

### Review

15\.—(1) Any monthly payment payable under this Act may be reviewed by the Commissioner on the application either of the employer or of the workman accompanied by a certificate of a medical practitioner that there has been a change in the condition of the workman.

(2) Any monthly payment may, on review under this section, and subject to the provisions of this Act, be continued, increased, decreased or ended.

[Act 16/90]

### Commutation of monthly payments.

16\. Any monthly payments may, where the payments have been continued for not less than 6 months, be commuted into a lump sum of such amount as may be agreed to by the parties and consented to by the Commissioner.

[Act 16/90]

### Liability in case of workmen employed by contractors

17\.—(1) Where any person (referred to in this section as the principal) in the course of or for the purpose of his trade or business contracts with any other person (referred to in this section as the contractor) for the execution by the contractor of the whole or any part of any work, or for the supply of labour to carry out any work, undertaken by the principal, the principal shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the execution of the work any compensation which he would have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately employed by him; and where a claim has been made against the principal for compensation this Act shall apply as if references to the principal were substituted for references to the employer, except that the amount of compensation shall be calculated with reference to the wages of the workman under the employer by whom he is immediately employed.

(2) Where the principal is liable to pay compensation under this section, he shall be entitled to be indemnified by the person who would have been liable to pay compensation to the workman independently of this section.

(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a workman from recovering compensation under this Act from the contractor instead of the principal, and a claim made against a principal or a contractor, as the case may be, shall not bar subsequent proceedings under this Act against the other to recover so much of the compensation as may remain unpaid.

(4) This section shall not apply in any case where the accident occurred elsewhere than at or about the place where the principal has undertaken to execute work or which is under his control or management.

[34/80]

### Remedies both against employer and stranger

18\. Where any injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof —

(a) the workman may take proceedings against that person to recover damages and may claim against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act, but he shall not be entitled to recover both damages and compensation; and

(2) If the liability of the insurer to the workman is less than the liability of the employer to the workman, the workman may prove for the balance in the bankruptcy or liquidation or, as the case may be, may recover the balance from the receiver or manager.

(3) Where in any case such as is referred to in subsection (1) the contract of the employer with the insurer is void or voidable by reason of non-compliance on the part of the employer with any terms or conditions of the contract (other than a stipulation for the payment of premiums), that subsection shall apply as if the contract were not void or voidable, and the insurer shall be entitled to prove in the bankruptcy or liquidation for the amount paid to the workman:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply in any case in which the workman fails to give notice to the insurer of the happening of the accident and of any resulting incapacity as soon as practicable after he becomes aware of the institution of the bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings and that the employer was insured and with whom.

the amount due in respect of any compensation or liability for compensation accrued before the following dates:

(ii) in the case mentioned in paragraph (b), the date of the commencement of the winding up of the company or, where the company is ordered to be wound up compulsorily and had not previously commenced to be wound up voluntarily, the date of the winding-up order; and

(iii) in the case mentioned in paragraph (c), the date of the appointment of the receiver or of possession being taken as mentioned in section 226 of the Companies Act.

(5) Where the compensation is a monthly payment, the amount due in respect thereof shall, for the purposes of this section, be taken to be the amount of the lump sum into which the monthly payment could, if commutable, be commuted if application were made for the purpose under section 16 and a certificate of the Commissioner as to the amount of such sum shall be conclusive proof thereof.

[Act 16/90 wef 01/09/1990]

(6) Subsection (4) shall apply in the case of any amount for which an insurer is entitled to prove under subsection (3), but otherwise subsection (4) shall not apply where the bankrupt or the company being wound up has entered into such a contract with the insurer as is referred to in subsection (1).

(7) This section shall not apply where a company is wound up voluntarily for the purpose only of reconstruction or of amalgamation with another company.

(b) in the case of the death of a master or seaman the claim for compensation shall be made within 6 months after the news of the death has been received by the claimant or, where the ship has been or is deemed to have been lost with all hands, within 18 months after the date on which the ship was or is deemed to have been so lost;

(c) where an injured master or seaman is discharged or left behind in any territory in the Commonwealth or in a foreign country, depositions respecting the circumstances and nature of the injury may be taken by any judge or magistrate in that territory or by a consular officer in the foreign country, and if so taken and transmitted by the person by whom they are taken to the Minister, they or certified copies thereof shall, in any proceedings for enforcing the claim, be admissible in evidence as provided by sections 339 and 345 of the Merchant Shipping Act [Cap. 179], and those sections shall apply accordingly;

[S 22/89 wef 30/03/1987]

(d) no monthly payment shall be payable in respect of the period during which the owner of the ship is, under any law relating to shipping in force for the time being in Singapore or any part thereof, liable to defray the expenses of maintenance of the injured master or seaman.

[1.9.90.]

### Contracting out

21\.

(3) Any employer who fails to insure himself in accordance with subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.

### Limitation of workman’s right of action

33\.—(1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to confer any right to compensation on a workman in respect of any injury if he has instituted an action for damages in respect of that injury in any court against his employer or if he has recovered damages in respect of that injury in any court from his employer, and no action for damages shall be maintainable in any court by a workman against his employer in respect of any injury —

(3) In any proceedings under subsection (2) when the court assesses the compensation, it shall give a certificate of the compensation it has awarded and the direction it has given, if any, as to the deduction of costs and such certificate shall have the same effect as a judgment of the court.
