3\.—(1) If in any employment personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to an employee, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

[5/2008]

(2) An accident happening to an employee while he is, with the express or implied permission of his employer, travelling as a passenger by any means of transport to or from his place of work shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of his employment if at the time of the accident the means of transport is being operated by or on behalf of his employer or by some other person by whom it is operated in pursuance of arrangements made with his employer and is not being operated in the ordinary course of a public transport service.

[5/2008]

(3) An accident happening to an employee in or about any premises at which he is for the time being employed for the purposes of his employer’s trade or business shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of his employment if it happens while he is taking steps, on an actual or supposed emergency at those premises, to rescue or protect persons who are, or are thought to be or possibly to be injured or imperilled, or to avert or minimise damage or loss to property.

[5/2008]

(4) An accident happening to an employee shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of his employment notwithstanding that he was at the time of the accident acting in contravention of any written law or other regulations applicable to his employment, or of any orders given by or on behalf of his employer, or that he was acting without instructions from his employer, if —

(a) the accident would have been deemed so to have arisen had such act not been done in contravention as aforesaid or without instructions from his employer, as the case may be; and

(b) such act was done for the purposes of and in connection with the employer’s trade or business.

[5/2008]

(5) An employer shall not be liable to pay compensation in respect of —

(a) any injury to an employee resulting from an accident if it is proved that the injury to the employee is directly attributable to the employee having been at the time thereof under the influence of alcohol or a drug not prescribed by a medical practitioner; or

(b) any incapacity or death resulting from a deliberate self-injury or the deliberate aggravation of an accidental injury.

[5/2008]

(5A) In this section, “drug” means —

(a) a controlled drug within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185); or

(b) a prescription only drug specified for the purposes of section 29 of the Medicines Act (Cap. 176) that is not prescribed by a medical practitioner for the employee’s consumption or use.

[5/2008]

(6) For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of an employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.

[5/2008]

### Compensation for occupational diseases

4\.—(1) If —

(a) an employee who is employed in any occupation specified in the second column of the Second Schedule contracts an occupational disease specified in the first column of that Schedule opposite that occupation; or

(b) an employee who has been employed in that occupation contracts that disease within the period specified in the third column of that Schedule opposite that occupation after ceasing to be so employed,

and the incapacity or death of the employee results from that disease, compensation shall be payable as if the disease were a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of that employment, and all the other provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly, subject to this section.

[5/2008]

(2) When an employee enters into a contract of service or apprenticeship with any employer to work in any occupation specified in the Second Schedule or is, with his consent, transferred by his employer to such an occupation, the employee shall, if requested to do so by the employer, submit himself for examination by a medical practitioner, the fee for which shall be paid by the employer; but he shall not be required to submit himself for such examination otherwise than in accordance with regulations made under this Act.

[5/2008]

(3) No compensation shall be payable by an employer under this section in respect of the incapacity or death of an employee resulting from the employee contracting an occupational disease if the employee’s incapacity commences or his death happens more than the period specified in the third column of the Second Schedule opposite the disease after the employee ceases to be in his employment.

[5/2008]

(3A) Subsection (3) shall not apply to the death of an employee where his death has been preceded, whether immediately or not, by any period of incapacity in respect of which compensation is payable under this section.

[5/2008]

(4) For the purposes of calculating the monthly earnings of the employee in a claim for compensation under this section, the date of commencement of the incapacity of the employee or the date of his death, if there has been no previous period of incapacity, shall be treated as the date of the happening of the accident, if he is then employed by the employer from whom compensation is claimed in any employment to the nature of which the occupational disease is due, and if he is not then so employed, the last day on which he was so employed shall for this purpose be deemed to be the date of the happening of the accident.

[5/2008]

(5) For all other purposes of this Act, in a claim for compensation under this section, the date of commencement of the incapacity of the employee, or the date on which a medical practitioner certifies that in his opinion the employee is suffering from such occupational disease, whichever date is the earlier, or the date of his death if there has been no previous period of incapacity shall be deemed to be the date of the happening of the accident.

[5/2008]

(6) If the occupational disease has been contracted by a gradual process, so that 2 or more employers are severally liable to pay compensation in respect thereof under this section, the aggregate amount of such compensation shall not exceed the amount that would have been payable if those employers had been a single employer, and in such case each of those employers shall, in default of agreement, be liable for such proportion of the compensation payable as the Commissioner thinks just.

[5/2008]

(7) The Minister may appoint such medical practitioners to be medical referees for the purpose of determining whether the disease in respect of which compensation is claimed is in fact an occupational disease specified in the Second Schedule and any other matter which is material for the determination of any claim for compensation under this Act.

[5/2008]

(8) The report of a medical referee appointed under subsection (7) may be acted upon by the Commissioner as if it were conclusive evidence of the facts certified in such report.

### Compensation limited to injuries received at work

5\. Except as provided in sections 3 and 4, no compensation shall be payable to an employee in respect of any disease unless the disease is directly attributable to a specific injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the relevant employment.

[5/2008]

### Persons entitled to compensation

6\.—(1) Compensation under this Act shall be payable to or for the benefit of the employee or, where death results from the injury, to the deceased employee’s estate or to or for the benefit of his dependants as provided by this Act.

[5/2008]

(2) Where a dependant dies before a claim under this Act is determined by the Commissioner, the legal personal representative of the dependant shall have no right to payment of compensation, and the amount of compensation shall be calculated and apportioned as if that dependant had died before the employee.

[5/2008]

(3) Where a deceased employee has no dependant, the compensation shall be paid into a fund to be known as the Workers’ Fund which shall be established, maintained and applied in accordance with regulations made under this Act and the person managing the Fund shall be entitled to claim the compensation.

[5/2008]

Division 2 —

Computation of compensation

### Amount of compensation

7\. The amount of compensation under this Act in respect of any personal injury of an employee caused by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment shall be computed in accordance with the Third Schedule.

[5/2008]

### Method of calculating earnings

8\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, the earnings of an employee shall be computed in such manner as is best calculated to give his true monthly earnings at the date of the accident, subject to the following provisions:

(a) where the employee has been employed by the employer for whom he was working at the time of the accident for a continuous period which is more than a month immediately preceding the accident, his monthly earnings shall be the average amount of his earnings during the continuous period of not more than 12 months immediately preceding the accident;

(b) where the employee has been employed by the employer for whom he was working at the time of the accident for a continuous period which is a month immediately preceding the accident or shorter, his monthly earnings shall be the actual earnings he would have received for the whole month immediately preceding the accident; and

(c) where reliable evidence of the earnings of the relevant employee under paragraph (a) or (b) does not exist or cannot be adduced without undue delay or expense, regard may be had to evidence of the earnings of employees employed on similar work in the same locality at or about the date of the accident.

[5/2008]

(2) Where an employee is employed under contracts of service with 2 or more employers under which he worked at one time for one such employer and at another time for another such employer, his monthly earnings shall be computed as if his earnings under all such contracts were earnings in the employment of the employer for whom he was working at the time of the accident, except contracts of service that the last-mentioned employer does not know.

[5/2008]

### Distribution of compensation

9\.—(1) Subject to subsection (1A), no payment of compensation in respect of an employee whose injury has resulted in death or permanent incapacity shall be made otherwise than by deposit with the Commissioner, and any such payment made directly to the employee or his dependant shall be deemed not to be payment of compensation for the purposes of this Act.

[5/2008]

(1A) The Commissioner may —

(a) in respect of injury which has resulted in the death or permanent incapacity of the employee, authorise payment of compensation to be made directly to —

(i) an employee who is not less than 18 years of age;

(ii) one or more of the dependants of the deceased employee and in such proportion as the Commissioner thinks fit, except that where a will has been produced, such payment may instead be made directly to the estate of the deceased employee; or

(iii) where the employee has become mentally incapacitated, any deputy appointed or deemed to be appointed for the employee by the High Court under the Mental Capacity Act 2008 with power to receive such payment;

[21/2008 wef 01/03/2010]

(b) take into account any amount paid otherwise than in accordance with subsection (1) in assessing the compensation payable under this Act if he considers it fair and reasonable to do so.

[5/2008]

(2) The receipt of the Commissioner shall be a sufficient discharge for any compensation deposited with him.

(3) On the deposit of any money under subsection (1) as compensation in respect of an accident resulting in the death of an employee, the Commissioner may deduct therefrom the actual amount of the expenses of the funeral of the employee or $250, whichever is the less, and may pay the same to the person by whom such expenses were incurred.

[5/2008]

(4) Compensation deposited in respect of an accident resulting in the death of an employee may be apportioned among one or more of the dependants of the deceased employee and in such proportion as the Commissioner thinks fit, except that where a will has been produced, such compensation may instead be paid to the estate of the deceased employee.

[5/2008]

(4A) Compensation deposited in respect of an accident resulting in the permanent incapacity of an employee who, before the payment of such compensation is made, becomes mentally incapacitated may be payable to —

(a) any one or more of the dependants of the employee; or

(b) any deputy appointed or deemed to be appointed for the employee by the High Court under the Mental Capacity Act 2008 with power to receive such payment.

[5/2008]

[21/2008 wef 01/03/2010]

(5) Where any lump sum deposited with the Commissioner is payable to a person who is under any legal disability or in any other case where the Commissioner considers it desirable to do so, the Commissioner may, in his discretion, order such sum to be invested, applied or otherwise dealt with for the benefit of that person in such manner and for such period as the Commissioner may determine.

(5A) Where any periodical payment of compensation for temporary incapacity is payable to any employee under a legal disability, the Commissioner may, of his own motion or on application made to him in that behalf, order that the payment be made during the disability to any dependant of the employee or to any other person whom the Commissioner thinks best fitted to provide for the welfare of the employee.

[16/90; 5/2008]

(6) If the Commissioner is satisfied after such inquiry as he may consider necessary that no dependant of a deceased employee exists or can be traced and the circumstances are such that there is no reasonable likelihood that any dependant can be traced, the Commissioner shall pay the balance of the money deposited with him under subsection (1) to the Workers’ Fund.

[5/2008]

(7) Where after inquiry made of his own motion or on application made to him the Commissioner is satisfied that by reason of any change in the circumstances of any dependant, or for any other sufficient cause, an order of the Commissioner made under this section ought to be varied, the Commissioner may make such order for the variation of that order as he thinks just in the circumstances of the case.

(8) No order prejudicial to any person shall be made under subsection (7) unless that person has been given an opportunity of showing cause why the order should not be made, and no such order shall require the repayment by a dependant of any sum already paid to him except where such payment has been obtained by fraud or other improper means.

### Compensation not to be assigned, attached or charged

10\. Subject to the provisions of this Act, no payment of compensation payable under this Act shall in any way be capable of being assigned or charged or be liable to attachment or pass to any person other than the employee by operation of law nor shall any claim be set off against the same.

[16/90; 5/2008]

Division 3 —

Making claims

### Notice and claim

11\.—(1) Except as provided in this section, proceedings for the recovery of compensation for an injury under this Act shall not be maintainable unless —

(a) notice of the accident has been given to the employer by or on behalf of the employee as soon as practicable after the happening thereof;

(b) a claim for compensation with respect to that accident has been made within one year from the happening of the accident causing the injury, or, in the case of death, within one year from the date of the death; and

(c) the claim has been made in such form and manner as the Commissioner may determine.

[34/80; 5/2008]

(2) No notice to the employer shall be necessary where a fatal accident has occurred.

(3) The want of or any defect or inaccuracy in a notice shall not be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings if —

(a) the employer is proved to have had knowledge of the accident from any other source at or about the time of the accident; or

(b) it is found in the proceedings for settling the claim that the employer is not, or would not be, if a notice or an amended notice were then given and the hearing postponed, prejudiced in his defence by the want, defect or inaccuracy, or that such want, defect or inaccuracy was occasioned by mistake, absence from Singapore or other reasonable cause.

(4) The failure to make a claim within the period specified in subsection (1) shall not be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings if it is found that the failure was occasioned by mistake, absence from Singapore or other reasonable cause.

(5) Notice to the employer (or, if there is more than one employer, to one of such employers) in respect of an injury may be given either in writing or orally or to the foreman or other person under whose supervision the employee was employed, or to any person designated for the purpose by the employer, and shall state in ordinary language the cause of the injury and the date on which and the place at which the accident happened.

[5/2008]

(6) The notice if in writing may be given by delivering the notice at, or sending it by registered post addressed to, the residence or place of business of the person to whom it is to be given.

### Notice to Commissioner and insurer by employer

12\.—(1) Every employer shall give notice to —

(a) the Commissioner in such form and manner as the Commissioner may determine; and

(b) his insurer in writing,

[5/2008]

(2) [Deleted byAct 5 of 2008]

(3) For the purposes of this section, “employer” shall include the person, if any, referred to in section 17 as the principal.

### Change of address

12A\.—(1) Where any claim for compensation has been made under this Act by an employee or by a person acting on behalf of an employee who is dead or mentally incapacitated, and the Commissioner has reason to believe that there is a change during the currency of the claim in the address used by the employee or the person for the purposes of the claim, the Commissioner may serve a notice on the employee or the person, as the case may be, requesting for particulars of any change in address.

[5/2008]

(2) Subject to subsection (3), the employee or the person acting on behalf of an employee who is dead or mentally incapacitated, as the case may be, on whom the Commissioner has served a notice under subsection (1) shall, within a period of 14 days after the service of the notice, inform the employee’s employer and the Commissioner, in writing or in person, of any change in address.

[5/2008]

(3) Subsection (2) shall not apply if the compensation has been fully paid in accordance with this Act.

[5/2008]

(4) Notwithstanding section 13(4), if an employee or the person acting on behalf of an employee who is dead or mentally incapacitated fails, without reasonable cause, to notify the Commissioner of any change in the address as is required by subsection (2), the employee’s right to compensation shall be suspended from the 15th day after the Commissioner has served a notice under subsection (1) on the employee or the person, as the case may be.

[5/2008]

(5) Any suspension under subsection (4) shall cease upon the employee or the person acting on behalf of an employee who is dead or mentally incapacitated, as the case may be, providing the particulars of any change in the address used by the employee or the person for the purposes of the claim.

[5/2008]

(6) If at the end of 3 months after the Commissioner has served a notice referred to in subsection (1), the employee or the person acting on behalf of an employee who is dead or mentally incapacitated, as the case may be, still fails to provide the particulars of any change in the address to the Commissioner as requested by that notice, then notwithstanding section 13(4), no compensation under this Act shall be payable in respect of the claim to which the notice relates unless the Commissioner is satisfied that there was reasonable cause for the failure.

[5/2008]

### Medical examination and treatment

[5/2008]

(2) In any proceedings brought against an insurer by virtue of subsection (1), the employer shall render all reasonable assistance to the insurer to enable the insurer to conduct any such proceedings and to defend any claim which the insurer decides to defend; and if the employer fails to do so he shall be liable to pay to the insurer any amount which has been paid or may become payable by the insurer as a result of those proceedings.

### Limitation of employee’s right of action

33\.—(1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to confer any right to compensation on an employee in respect of any injury if he has instituted an action for damages in respect of that injury in any court against his employer or if he has recovered damages in respect of that injury in any court from his employer.

[5/2008]

(2) Subject to subsections (2A) and (2B), no action for damages shall be maintainable in any court by an employee against his employer in respect of any injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment —

(b) if he and his employer have agreed or are deemed to have agreed to the notice of assessment under section 24(2)(a) for that injury; or

(c) if he has recovered damages in respect of the injury in any court from any other person.

[5/2008]

(2A) Where —

(a) a claim for compensation under this Act is made for an employee’s injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment;

the employee may institute an action in any court against his employer for damages in respect of that injury and any order made by the Commissioner in respect of that injury shall be void.

[5/2008]

(2B) Where —

(a) the Commissioner assesses or makes an order that no compensation shall be payable for a claim for compensation for an employee’s injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment because —

(i) the injury did not arise out of and in the course of the employee’s employment; or

(ii) the injured person is not an employee within the meaning of this Act; or

(b) an appeal to the High Court under section 29 from an order made by the Commissioner has failed because of any reason mentioned in paragraph (a)(i) or (ii),

the employee may institute an action in any court to recover damages independently of this Act for injury caused by that accident.

[5/2008]

(3) If an action is brought within the time specified in section 11 in any court to recover damages independently of this Act for injury caused by any accident and it is determined in the action or on appeal that the injury is one for which the employer is not liable but that he would have been liable to pay compensation under the provisions of this Act, the action shall be dismissed; but the court shall, if the employee so chooses, proceed to assess the compensation and may deduct therefrom all or any part of the costs which, in its judgment, have been caused by the employee instituting the action instead of proceeding under this Act.

[5/2008]

(4) In any proceedings under subsection (3) when the court assesses the compensation, it shall give a certificate of the compensation it has awarded and the direction it has given, if any, as to the deduction of costs and such certificate shall have the same effect as a judgment of the court.

### Reciprocal arrangements for payment of work injury compensation

34\. Where an arrangement has been made between the Government and the government of any other State whereby sums awarded under the law relating to work injury compensation in Singapore to persons resident or becoming resident in the territory administered by any such government, and sums awarded under the law relating to work injury compensation in any such territory to persons resident or becoming resident in Singapore, may at the request of the authority by which the award is made be transferred to and administered by a competent authority in any such territory or by the Commissioner in Singapore, as the case may be, money in the hands of the Commissioner shall be transferred, and money received by him shall be administered, in such manner as may be prescribed.

(3) Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (2), where the injured employee is certified by a medical practitioner to have suffered from permanent total incapacity, additional compensation shall be paid amounting to one quarter of the amount which is otherwise payable under this paragraph.

3.—(1) Where permanent partial incapacity results from the injury, the amount of compensation shall be —

(a) in the case of an injury specified in the First Schedule, such percentage of the compensation which would have been payable in the case of permanent total incapacity as is specified therein as being the percentage of the loss of earning capacity caused by that injury; and

(2) Where more injuries than one are caused by the same accident the amount of compensation payable in respect of all such injuries shall be aggregated but not so as to exceed in any case the amount which would have been payable in respect of permanent total incapacity.

4.—(1) Where temporary incapacity whether total or partial results from the injury, the employee shall be entitled to full earnings for a period of 60 days if he is hospitalised and 14 days if he is not hospitalised and thereafter to a further periodical payment of an amount equal to two-thirds of his earnings during the incapacity or during a period of one year, whichever period is shorter.

(2) No payment under sub-paragraph (1) shall be deducted from the lump sum payable in respect of any permanent incapacity which follows any period of temporary incapacity.

(3) If the temporary incapacity of the employee ceases before the date on which any payment under sub-paragraph (1) falls due, he shall be paid an amount as is appropriate to the duration of such temporary incapacity.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, where an employee is certified by a medical practitioner of an approved hospital to be ill enough to need to be hospitalised but the employee is not hospitalised for any reason whatsoever, he shall be deemed to be hospitalised.

5.—(1) Any compensation payable by an employer for the medical treatment received by an employee in relation to his injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment shall be the lower of the following amounts:

(a) the cost of medical treatment received by the employee within a period of one year after the happening of the accident causing the injury; or
