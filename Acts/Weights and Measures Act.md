20\.—(1) Subject to this section, in any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, being an offence relating to the quantity or pre-packing of any goods, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove —

(a) that he bought the goods from some other person —

(i) as being of the quantity which the person charged purported to sell or represented, or which was marked on any container or stated in any document to which the proceedings relate; or

(ii) as conforming with the statement marked on any container to which the proceedings relate, or with the requirements of this Act and any subsidiary legislation made thereunder with respect to the pre-packing of goods,

as the case may require;

(b) that he so bought the goods with a written warranty from that other person that they were of that quantity or, as the case may be, did so conform;

(c) that at the time of the commission of the offence he had no reason to believe the statement contained in the warranty to be inaccurate, that he did in fact believe in its accuracy and, if the warranty was given by a person who at the time he gave it was resident outside Singapore, that the person charged had taken reasonable steps to check the accuracy of that statement; and

(d) in the case of proceedings relating to the quantity of any goods, that he took all reasonable steps to ensure that, while in his possession the quantity of the goods remained unchanged and, in the case of such or any other proceedings, that apart from any change in their quantity the goods were at the time of the commission of the offence in the same state as when he bought them.

(2) A warranty shall be a defence in such proceedings only if, not later than 7 days before the date of the hearing, the person charged has sent to the prosecutor a copy of the warranty with a notice stating that he intends to rely on it and specifying the name and address of the person from whom the warranty was received, and has also sent a like notice to that person.

(3) Where the person charged is a servant of a person who, if he had been charged, would have been entitled to plead a warranty as a defence under this section, subsection (1) shall have effect as if any reference (however expressed) in paragraphs (a) to (d) of that subsection to the person charged, other than the first such reference in paragraph (c) of that subsection, were a reference to his employer.

(4) The person by whom the warranty is alleged to have been given shall be entitled to appear at the hearing and to give evidence.

(5) If the person charged in any such proceedings wilfully attributes to any goods a warranty given in relation to any other goods, he shall be guilty of an offence.

(6) A person who, in respect of any goods sold by him in respect of which a warranty might be pleaded under this section, gives to the buyer a false warranty in writing shall be guilty of an offence unless he proves that when he gave the warranty he took all reasonable steps to ensure that the statements contained therein were, and would continue at all relevant times to be, accurate.

(7) For the purposes of this section, any statement with respect to any goods which is contained in any document required by this Act to be associated with the goods or in any invoice, and, in the case of goods made up in or on a container for sale or for delivery after sale, any statement with respect to those goods with which that container is marked, shall be deemed to be a written warranty of the accuracy of that statement.

### Additional defences and safeguards for traders

21\.—(1) In any proceedings for an offence in respect of any goods under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove —

(a) that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake, or to an accident or some other cause beyond his control; and

(b) that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence in respect of those goods by himself or any person under his control.

(2) In any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder by reason of the quantity —

(a) of any goods made up for sale or for delivery after sale (whether by way of pre-packing or otherwise) or in or on a container marked with an indication of quantity;

(b) of any goods which, in connection with a sale or agreement for the sale thereof, have associated therewith a document purporting to state the quantity of the goods; or

(c) of any goods required by this Act to be pre-packed, or to be otherwise made up in or on a container for sale or for delivery after sale, or to be made for sale, only in particular quantities,

being less than that marked on the container or stated in the document in question or than the relevant particular quantity, as the case may be, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that the deficiency arose —

(i) in a case falling within paragraph (a), after the making up of the goods and the marking of the container;

(ii) in a case falling within paragraph (b), after the preparation of the goods for delivery in pursuance of the sale or agreement and after the completion of the document;

(iii) in the case falling within paragraph (c), after the making up or making, as the case may be, of the goods for sale,

and was attributable wholly to factors for which reasonable allowance was made in stating the quantity of the goods in the marking or document or in making up or making the goods for sale, as the case may be.

(3) In the case of a sale by retail of food, not being food pre-packed in a container which is, or is required by this Act to be, marked with an indication of quantity, in any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder by reason of the quantity delivered to the buyer being less than that purported to be sold, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that the deficiency was due wholly to unavoidable evaporation or drainage since the sale and that due care and precaution were taken to minimise any such evaporation or drainage.

(4) Without prejudice to any defence under subsection (2) or (3), in any proceedings for such an offence in respect of any goods as is mentioned in subsection (2) it shall not be a defence under subsection (1)(a) for the person charged to prove that the commission of the offence was due to some cause beyond his control if that cause was one which should reasonably have been foreseen and for which allowance could reasonably have been made in stating the quantity of the goods or in making up or making the goods, as the case may be.

(5) If in any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, being an offence in respect of any deficiency in the quantity of any goods sold, it is shown that between the sale and the discovery of the deficiency the goods were with the consent of the buyer subjected to treatment which could result in a reduction in the quantity of those goods for delivery to, or to any person nominated in that behalf by, the buyer, the person charged shall not be found guilty of that offence unless it is shown that the deficiency cannot be accounted for by the subjecting of the goods to that treatment.

(6) In any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, being an offence in respect of any excess in the quantity of any goods, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that the excess was attributable to the taking of measures reasonably necessary in order to avoid the commission of an offence in respect of a deficiency in those or other goods.

(7) If proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder in respect of any deficiency or excess in the quantity —

(a) of any goods made up for sale (whether by way of pre-packing or otherwise) in or on a container marked with an indication of quantity;

(b) of any goods which have been pre-packed or otherwise made up in or on a container for sale or for delivery after sale, or which have been made for sale, and which are required by this Act to be pre-packed, or to be otherwise so made up, or to be so made, as the case may be, only in particular quantities,

are brought with respect to any article, and it is proved that, at the time and place at which that article was tested, other articles of the same kind, being articles which, or articles containing goods which, had been sold by the person charged or were in that person’s possession for sale or for delivery after sale, were available for testing, the person charged shall not be convicted of such an offence with respect to that article unless a reasonable number of those other articles was also tested; and in any proceedings for such an offence the court —

(i) if the proceedings are with respect to one or more of a number of articles tested on the same occasion, shall have regard to the average quantity in all the articles tested;

(ii) if the proceedings are with respect to a single article, shall disregard any inconsiderable deficiency or excess; and

(iii) shall have regard generally to all the circumstances of the case.

### Offence relating to document containing particular statements

21A\. If, in the case of any goods required by this Act to have associated therewith a document containing particular statements, that document is found to contain any such statement which is materially incorrect, any person who, knowing or having reasonable cause to suspect that statement to be materially incorrect, inserted it or caused it to be inserted in the document, or used the document for the purposes of this Act or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder while that statement was contained therein, shall be guilty of an offence.

[30/2005 wef 01/01/2006]

22\.—(1) A person against whom proceedings are brought for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder shall, upon information duly laid by him and on giving to the prosecutor not less than 7 clear days’ notice of his intention to avail himself of this subsection be entitled to have brought before the court in those proceedings any other person to whose act or default he alleges that the commission of the offence was due; and if, after the offence has been proved, the original defendant proves that the commission thereof was due to an act or default of that other person —

(a) that other person may be convicted of the offence; and

(b) if the original defendant further proves that he exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence by him or any person under his control, the original defendant shall be acquitted of the offence.

(2) Where a defendant seeks to avail himself of subsection (1) —

(a) the prosecutor, as well as the person whom the defendant charges with the offence, shall have the right to cross-examine the defendant, if he gives evidence, and any witness called by the defendant in support of his pleas, and to call rebutting evidence; and
