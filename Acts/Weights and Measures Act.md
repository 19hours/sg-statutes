(a) the yard shall be 0.9144 metre exactly; and

(b) the pound shall be 0.453 592 37 kilogram exactly.

(2) The First Schedule shall have effect for defining, for the purposes of measurements falling to be made in Singapore, the units of measurements set out in that Schedule; and for the purposes of any measurement of weight falling to be so made, the weight of anything may be expressed, by reference to the units of measurements set out in Part V of that Schedule, in the same terms as its mass.

(3) The Minister may by order\*amend subsection (1) —

\*No order has been made as at 31st December 1986.

(a) by deleting the yard as the unit of measurement of length; and

(b) by deleting the pound as the unit of measurement of mass,

by reference to which any measurement involving a measurement of length or mass shall be made in Singapore.

### Standard weights and measures

4\.—(1) The Minister shall cause to be maintained standards of the yard, pound, metre and kilogram which shall be the standards (referred to in this Act as the Singapore standards) by reference to which, in Singapore, all other standards of those units and of any other unit of measurement derived wholly or partly from any of those units shall be maintained.

(2) The Minister shall from time to time as may appear to him expedient cause —

(a) the value of each of the Singapore standards to be determined or redetermined; and

(b) any authorised copy of any of those standards to be compared with, and its value determined or redetermined by reference to, that standard,

in such manner as the Minister may direct.

(3) The secondary standards shall consist of standards of all the measures set out in Parts I and II and all the weights set out in Part III of the Second Schedule other than capacity measures of more than one gallon or 10 litres; and any such standard shall be constructed, and, while it remains in use, from time to time at intervals not exceeding 5 years have its value or values redetermined, by reference to such one or more of the Singapore standards or any authorised copies thereof as may appear to the Minister to be appropriate.

(4) The tertiary standards shall consist of such standards of such of the measures or weights set out in the Second Schedule as may from time to time appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient; and any such standard shall be constructed, and, while it remains so in use, from time to time at intervals not exceeding two years have its value or values redetermined, by reference to such one or more of the secondary standards as may appear to the Minister to be appropriate.

(5) The standards referred to in subsections (3) and (4) shall be provided or replaced by the Minister from time to time as may appear to him necessary or expedient and shall be in such form and of such material, and be kept under the control of the Minister at such place or places, as the Minister may think fit; and a secondary or tertiary standard of any linear or capacity measure may —

(a) be provided either as a separate standard or by means of divisions marked on a standard of a larger measure; and

## PART III

WEIGHING AND MEASURING FOR TRADE

### Meaning of “use for trade”

5\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, “use for trade” means, subject to subsection (2), use in Singapore in connection with, or with a view to, a transaction for —

(a) the transferring or rendering of money or money’s worth in consideration of money or money’s worth; or

(b) the making of a payment in respect of any toll or duty,

where —

(i) the transaction is by reference to quantity or is a transaction for the purposes of which there is made or implied a statement of the quantity of goods to which the transaction relates; and

(ii) the use is for the purpose of the determination or statement of that quantity.

(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply where —

(a) the determination or statement is a determination or statement of the quantity of goods required for despatch to a destination outside Singapore;

(b) the transaction is not a sale by retail; and

(c) no transfer or rendering of money or money’s worth is involved other than the passing of the title to the goods and the consideration therefor.

(3) Any weighing or measuring equipment which is made available in Singapore for use by the public, whether on payment or otherwise, shall be treated for the purposes of this Part as weighing or measuring equipment in use for trade, whether or not it would apart from this subsection be so treated.

### Units of measurements and weights lawful for use for trade

6\.—(1) Subject to section 40, no person shall use for trade any unit of measurement of length, area, volume, capacity, mass or weight which is not included in the First Schedule.

(2) No person shall use the carat (metric) for trade except for the purposes of transactions in precious stones or pearls; and no person shall use the ounce troy for trade except for the purposes of transactions in, or in articles made from, gold, silver or other precious metals, including transactions in gold or silver thread, lace or fringe.

(3) No person shall use the ounce apothecaries, drachm, scruple, fluid drachm or minim for trade otherwise than for the purposes of transactions in drugs.

(5) The Minister may by regulations prescribe what may be treated for the purposes of use for trade as the equivalent of, or of any multiple or fraction of, any unit of measurement or weight included in the First Schedule in terms of any other such unit.

(6) Subsection (1) shall not apply to the prescribing of, or the dispensing of a prescription for, drugs, and nothing in any regulations made under subsection (5) shall apply to any transaction in drugs; but the Minister for Health may by regulations, which shall have effect notwithstanding anything in, or in any subsidiary legislation made under, any other enactment —

(a) prescribe what may be treated for the purposes of dealings with drugs as the equivalent of, or of any multiple or fraction of, any unit of measurement which is included in the First Schedule in terms of any other such unit;

(b) require that any person carrying out any such dealing with drugs, as is specified in the regulations for the purposes of which the quantity of the drugs is expressed in terms of any such unit which is so specified, shall carry out that dealing in terms of such equivalent quantity prescribed under paragraph (a) as is so specified.

(7) The Minister may from time to time by order amend the First Schedule by adding to or removing from Parts I to V of that Schedule any unit of measurement of length, of area, of volume, of capacity, or of mass or weight, as the case may be.

### Weighing or measuring equipment for use for trade

7\.—(1) This section shall apply to the use for trade of weighing or measuring equipment of such classes or descriptions as may be prescribed.

(2) No person shall use any article for trade as equipment to which this section applies, or have any article in his possession for such use, unless that article, or equipment to which this section applies in which that article is incorporated or to the operation of which the use of that article is incidental, has been passed by an inspector as fit for such used and, except as otherwise expressly provided under this Act, bears a stamp indicating that it has been so passed which remains undefaced otherwise than by reason of fair wear and tear.

(3) Any person who contravenes subsection (2) shall be guilty of an offence and any article in respect of which the offence was committed shall be liable to be forfeited.

(4) Any person requiring any equipment to which this section applies to be passed as fit for use for trade shall submit the equipment to an inspector in such manner as the Controller may direct and, subject to the provisions of this Act and any regulations made under section 10 and to the payment by that person of the prescribed fee, the inspector shall —

(a) test the equipment by means of such working standards and testing equipment as he considers appropriate or, subject to any conditions which may be prescribed, by means of other equipment which has already been tested and which the inspector considers suitable for the purpose;

(b) if the equipment submitted falls within the prescribed limits of error, give to the person submitting it a certificate in writing to the effect that it is passed as aforesaid; and

(c) except as otherwise expressly provided for under this Act, cause it to be stamped with the prescribed stamp,

and each inspector shall keep a record of every such test carried out by him;

Provided that, except as otherwise expressly provided under this Act, no weight or measure shall be stamped as mentioned in paragraph (c) unless it has been marked in the prescribed manner with its purported value.

(5) Where any equipment submitted to an inspector under subsection (4) is of a pattern in respect of which a certificate of approval granted under section 8 is for the time being in force, or of such a pattern modified only in a manner for the time being authorised by the Controller under that section, the inspector shall not refuse to pass or stamp the equipment on the ground that it is not suitable for use for trade:

Provided that if the inspector is of the opinion that the equipment is intended for use for trade for a particular purpose for which it is not suitable, he may refuse to pass or stamp it until the matter has been referred to the Controller, and the Controller’s decision shall be final.

(6) The requirements of subsections (2) and (4) with respect to stamping and marking shall not apply to any weight or measure which is too small to be stamped or marked in accordance with those requirements.

(7) In the case of any equipment which is required by regulations made under section 10 to be passed and stamped under this section only after it has been installed at the place where it is to be used for trade, if after the equipment has been so passed and stamped it is dismantled and reinstalled, whether in the same or some other place, it shall not be used for trade after being so reinstalled until it has been retested by an inspector; and if any person knowingly uses that equipment in contravention of this subsection, or knowingly causes or permits any other person so to use it, or knowing that the equipment is required by virtue of this subsection to be retested disposes of it to some other person without informing him of that requirement, he shall be guilty of an offence and the equipment shall be liable to be forfeited.

### Approved patterns of equipment for use for trade

8\.—(1) Where any pattern of weighing or measuring equipment is submitted to the Controller for the purpose by any person in such manner as may be prescribed, the Controller shall, on payment of the prescribed fee, examine in such manner as he thinks fit the suitability for use for trade of equipment of that pattern, having regard in particular to the principle, materials and methods used or proposed to be used in its construction, and if the Controller is satisfied that such equipment is suitable for use for trade, then, subject to section 9(2), he shall issue a certificate of approval of that pattern and cause particulars thereof to be published and may from time to time thereafter authorise such minor modifications thereof as he thinks fit and cause particulars of those modifications to be published:

Provided that the requirements of this subsection as to the publication of the particulars of any pattern or modification shall not apply where the certificate of approval is issued subject to such a condition as is mentioned in subsection (2).

(2) A certificate of approval under subsection (1) may be granted subject to a condition that, except with the consent of the Controller, equipment of the pattern in question shall be used for trade only for a specified period or only for a specified purpose; and if any person, knowing that such a condition has been imposed with respect to any equipment, uses, or causes or permits any other person to use, that equipment in contravention of that condition, or disposes of that equipment to any other person in a state in which it could be used for trade without informing that other person of that condition, he shall be guilty of an offence and the equipment shall be liable to be forfeited.

(3) The Controller, after consultation with such persons appearing to him to be interested as he thinks fit, may at any time revoke any certificate or authorisation granted under this section, and shall cause notice of any such revocation to be published; and where the Controller so revokes any certificate or authorisation, then if any person, knowing that the certificate or authorisation has been revoked, and save as may be permitted by any fresh certificate or authorisation granted in respect thereof, uses for trade, or has in his possession for such use, or causes or permits any other person so to use, any equipment of the pattern or incorporating the modification in question, or disposes of any such equipment to any other person in a state in which it could be so used without informing that other person of the revocation he shall be guilty of an offence and the equipment shall be liable to be forfeited.

(4) Any equipment of a pattern in respect of which a certificate of approval has been granted under this section may, and in such cases as may be prescribed, shall, be marked in the prescribed manner so as to identify it with the pattern in question.

### General specifications of equipment for use for trade

9\.—(1) The Minister may by regulations prescribe general specifications for the construction of equipment to which section 7 applies and, subject to subsection (4), while any such specification is for the time being so prescribed no equipment which does not conform therewith shall be passed or stamped by an inspector under section 7 unless it is of a pattern in respect of which a certificate of approval under section 8 is in force or of a pattern modified only in a manner for the time being authorised by the Controller under section 8.

(2) If the Controller is satisfied that any pattern submitted to him under section 8(1) conforms to any general specification for the time being prescribed under this section, he may, instead of issuing a certificate of approval under that subsection, cause to be published a declaration to that effect together with particulars of that pattern.

(3) Where any specification prescribed by regulations made under this section is varied or revoked by further regulations made thereunder, then if any person uses for trade, or has in his possession for such use, or causes or permits any other person so to use, any equipment which conformed with that specification but which to his knowledge no longer conforms to any specification to prescribed, or disposes of any such equipment to any other person in a state in which it could be so used without informing that other person that it no longer so conforms, he shall be guilty of an offence and the equipment shall be liable to be forfeited.

(4) Where, in the case of any particular equipment, the Controller is of the opinion that there are special circumstances which make it impracticable or unnecessary for that equipment to comply with any particular requirement of any specification prescribed under this section, the Controller may exempt that equipment from that requirement subject to compliance with such conditions, if any, as he thinks fit; and if any person knowingly contravenes any condition imposed with respect to any equipment by virtue of this subsection, he shall be guilty of an offence and the equipment shall be liable to be forfeited.

(5) If any difference arises between an inspector and any other person as to the interpretation of any specification prescribed under this section, or as to whether or not any equipment conforms to such a specification, that difference may with the consent of that person, and shall at the request of that other person, be referred to the Controller, whose decision shall be final.

### Regulations relating to weighing or measuring for trade

10\.—(1) The Minister may make regulations with respect to —

(a) the materials and principles of construction of weighing or measuring equipment for use for trade;

(b) the inspection, testing, passing as fit for use for trade and stamping of such equipment, including —

(i) the prohibition of the stamping of such equipment in such circumstances as may be specified in the regulations;

(ii) the circumstances in which an inspector may remove or detain any such equipment for inspection or testing; and

(b) forges, counterfeits or, except as permitted under this Act, in any way alters or defaces any stamp;

(c) removes any stamp and inserts it into any other such equipment; or

(d) makes any alteration in the equipment after it has been stamped such as to make it false or unjust,

shall be guilty of an offence:

Provided that paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply to the destruction or obliteration of any stamp, plug or seal in the course of the adjustment or repair of weighing or measuring equipment by, or by the duly authorised agent of, a person who is a manufacturer of, or regularly engaged in the business of repairing, such equipment.

(2) Any person who uses for trade, sells, or exposes or offers for sale any weighing or measuring equipment which to his knowledge —

(a) bears a stamp which is a forgery or counterfeit, or which has been transferred from other equipment, or which has been altered or defaced otherwise than as permitted under this Act; or

(b) is false or unjust as the result of an alteration made in the equipment after it has been stamped,

shall be guilty of an offence.

(3) Any weighing or measuring equipment in respect of which an offence under this section is committed, and any stamp or stamping implement used in the commission of the offence, shall be liable to be forfeited.

### Power to ban use of weighing or measuring equipment

12\.—(1) The Minister may by order prohibit the use of any weighing or measuring equipment for such purposes as he may specify, notwithstanding that the weighing or measuring equipment has been inspected, tested and passed as fit for use for trade under this Part, if he is satisfied that the use of such weighing or measuring equipment should be discontinued for such purposes as may be specified in the order.

(2) If any person uses for trade, or has in his possession for trade, any weighing or measuring equipment to which an order made under subsection (1) applies, he shall be guilty of an offence and the equipment shall be liable to be forfeited.

### Pleading of warranty as defence

20\.—(1) Subject to this section, in any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, being an offence relating to the quantity or pre-packing of any goods, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove —

(a) that he bought the goods from some other person —

(i) as being of the quantity which the person charged purported to sell or represented, or which was marked on any container or stated in any document to which the proceedings relate; or

(ii) as conforming with the statement marked on any container to which the proceedings relate, or with the requirements of this Act and any subsidiary legislation made thereunder with respect to the pre-packing of goods,

as the case may require;

(b) that he so bought the goods with a written warranty from that other person that they were of that quantity or, as the case may be, did so conform;

(c) that at the time of the commission of the offence he had no reason to believe the statement contained in the warranty to be inaccurate, that he did in fact believe in its accuracy and, if the warranty was given by a person who at the time he gave it was resident outside Singapore, that the person charged had taken reasonable steps to check the accuracy of that statement; and

(d) in the case of proceedings relating to the quantity of any goods, that he took all reasonable steps to ensure that, while in his possession the quantity of the goods remained unchanged and, in the case of such or any other proceedings, that apart from any change in their quantity the goods were at the time of the commission of the offence in the same state as when he bought them.

(2) A warranty shall be a defence in such proceedings only if, not later than 7 days before the date of the hearing, the person charged has sent to the prosecutor a copy of the warranty with a notice stating that he intends to rely on it and specifying the name and address of the person from whom the warranty was received, and has also sent a like notice to that person.

(3) Where the person charged is a servant of a person who, if he had been charged, would have been entitled to plead a warranty as a defence under this section, subsection (1) shall have effect as if any reference (however expressed) in paragraphs (a) to (d) of that subsection to the person charged, other than the first such reference in paragraph (c) of that subsection, were a reference to his employer.

(4) The person by whom the warranty is alleged to have been given shall be entitled to appear at the hearing and to give evidence.

(5) If the person charged in any such proceedings wilfully attributes to any goods a warranty given in relation to any other goods, he shall be guilty of an offence.

(6) A person who, in respect of any goods sold by him in respect of which a warranty might be pleaded under this section, gives to the buyer a false warranty in writing shall be guilty of an offence unless he proves that when he gave the warranty he took all reasonable steps to ensure that the statements contained therein were, and would continue at all relevant times to be, accurate.

(7) For the purposes of this section, any statement with respect to any goods which is contained in any document required by this Act to be associated with the goods or in any invoice, and, in the case of goods made up in or on a container for sale or for delivery after sale, any statement with respect to those goods with which that container is marked, shall be deemed to be a written warranty of the accuracy of that statement.

### Additional defences and safeguards for traders

21\.—(1) In any proceedings for an offence in respect of any goods under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove —

(a) that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake, or to an accident or some other cause beyond his control; and

(b) that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence in respect of those goods by himself or any person under his control.

(2) In any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder by reason of the quantity —

(a) of any goods made up for sale or for delivery after sale (whether by way of pre-packing or otherwise) or in or on a container marked with an indication of quantity;

(b) of any goods which, in connection with a sale or agreement for the sale thereof, have associated therewith a document purporting to state the quantity of the goods; or

(c) of any goods required by this Act to be pre-packed, or to be otherwise made up in or on a container for sale or for delivery after sale, or to be made for sale, only in particular quantities,

being less than that marked on the container or stated in the document in question or than the relevant particular quantity, as the case may be, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that the deficiency arose —

(i) in a case falling within paragraph (a), after the making up of the goods and the marking of the container;

(ii) in a case falling within paragraph (b), after the preparation of the goods for delivery in pursuance of the sale or agreement and after the completion of the document;

(iii) in the case falling within paragraph (c), after the making up or making, as the case may be, of the goods for sale,

and was attributable wholly to factors for which reasonable allowance was made in stating the quantity of the goods in the marking or document or in making up or making the goods for sale, as the case may be.

(3) In the case of a sale by retail of food, not being food pre-packed in a container which is, or is required by this Act to be, marked with an indication of quantity, in any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder by reason of the quantity delivered to the buyer being less than that purported to be sold, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that the deficiency was due wholly to unavoidable evaporation or drainage since the sale and that due care and precaution were taken to minimise any such evaporation or drainage.

(4) Without prejudice to any defence under subsection (2) or (3), in any proceedings for such an offence in respect of any goods as is mentioned in subsection (2) it shall not be a defence under subsection (1)(a) for the person charged to prove that the commission of the offence was due to some cause beyond his control if that cause was one which should reasonably have been foreseen and for which allowance could reasonably have been made in stating the quantity of the goods or in making up or making the goods, as the case may be.

(5) If in any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, being an offence in respect of any deficiency in the quantity of any goods sold, it is shown that between the sale and the discovery of the deficiency the goods were with the consent of the buyer subjected to treatment which could result in a reduction in the quantity of those goods for delivery to, or to any person nominated in that behalf by, the buyer, the person charged shall not be found guilty of that offence unless it is shown that the deficiency cannot be accounted for by the subjecting of the goods to that treatment.

(6) In any proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder, being an offence in respect of any excess in the quantity of any goods, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that the excess was attributable to the taking of measures reasonably necessary in order to avoid the commission of an offence in respect of a deficiency in those or other goods.

(7) If proceedings for an offence under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder in respect of any deficiency or excess in the quantity —

(a) of any goods made up for sale (whether by way of pre-packing or otherwise) in or on a container marked with an indication of quantity;

(b) of any goods which have been pre-packed or otherwise made up in or on a container for sale or for delivery after sale, or which have been made for sale, and which are required by this Act to be pre-packed, or to be otherwise so made up, or to be so made, as the case may be, only in particular quantities,

are brought with respect to any article, and it is proved that, at the time and place at which that article was tested, other articles of the same kind, being articles which, or articles containing goods which, had been sold by the person charged or were in that person’s possession for sale or for delivery after sale, were available for testing, the person charged shall not be convicted of such an offence with respect to that article unless a reasonable number of those other articles was also tested; and in any proceedings for such an offence the court —

(i) if the proceedings are with respect to one or more of a number of articles tested on the same occasion, shall have regard to the average quantity in all the articles tested;

(ii) if the proceedings are with respect to a single article, shall disregard any inconsiderable deficiency or excess; and

(iii) shall have regard generally to all the circumstances of the case.

(b) the court may make such order as it thinks fit for the payment of costs by any party to the proceedings to any other party thereto.

(3) Where it appears to any authority by or on behalf of whom proceedings of such an offence may be instituted that such an offence has been committed by some person, and that authority is reasonably satisfied that the offence was due to an act or default of some other person and that the first-mentioned person could establish a defence under subsection (1), that authority may take or authorise the taking of proceedings against that other person without first taking or authorising the taking of proceedings against the first-mentioned person; and in any such proceedings that other person may be charged with, and, on proof that the commission of the offence was due to his act or default, be convicted of, the offence with which the first-mentioned person might have been charged.

(4) Where by virtue of subsection (3) a person is charged with an offence with which some other person might have been charged, the reference in section 21(7) to articles or goods sold by or in the possession of the person charged shall be construed as a reference to articles or goods sold by or in the possession of that other person.
