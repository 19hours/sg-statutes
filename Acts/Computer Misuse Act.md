“computer output” or “output” means a statement or representation (whether in written, printed, pictorial, graphical or other form) purporting to be a statement or representation of fact —

(a) produced by a computer; or

(b) accurately translated from a statement or representation so produced;

“computer service” includes computer time, data processing and the storage or retrieval of data;

“data” means representations of information or of concepts that are being prepared or have been prepared in a form suitable for use in a computer;

“electronic, acoustic, mechanical or other device” means any device or apparatus that is used or is capable of being used to intercept any function of a computer;

“function” includes logic, control, arithmetic, deletion, storage and retrieval and communication or telecommunication to, from or within a computer;

“intercept”, in relation to a function of a computer, includes listening to or recording a function of a computer, or acquiring the substance, meaning or purport thereof;

“program or computer program” means data representing instructions or statements that, when executed in a computer, causes the computer to perform a function.

(2) For the purposes of this Act, a person secures access to any program or data held in a computer if by causing a computer to perform any function he —

(a) alters or erases the program or data;

(b) copies or moves it to any storage medium other than that in which it is held or to a different location in the storage medium in which it is held;

(c) uses it; or

(d) causes it to be output from the computer in which it is held (whether by having it displayed or in any other manner),

and references to access to a program or data (and to an intent to secure such access) shall be read accordingly.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), a person uses a program if the function he causes the computer to perform —

(a) causes the program to be executed; or

(b) is itself a function of the program.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (2)(d), the form in which any program or data is output (and in particular whether or not it represents a form in which, in the case of a program, it is capable of being executed or, in the case of data, it is capable of being processed by a computer) is immaterial.

(5) For the purposes of this Act, access of any kind by any person to any program or data held in a computer is unauthorised or done without authority if —

(a) any program or data held in the computer concerned is altered or erased;

(b) any program or data is added to its contents; or

(c) any act occurs which impairs the normal operation of any computer,

[S 92/97]

and any act which contributes towards causing such a modification shall be regarded as causing it.

(8) Any modification referred to in subsection (7) is unauthorised if —

(a) the person whose act causes it is not himself entitled to determine whether the modification should be made; and

(b) he does not have consent to the modification from any person who is so entitled.

(9) A reference in this Act to a program includes a reference to part of a program.

(3) An order of compensation under this section shall be recoverable as a civil debt.

### Evidence from computer records

11\.—(1) Notwithstanding sections 35 and 36 of the Evidence Act [Cap. 97], in any proceedings under this Act, any relevant computer output shall be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein if it is shown —

(a) that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the output is inaccurate because of improper use of the computer and that no reason exists to doubt or suspect the truth or reliability of the output; or

(b) that at all material times the computer was operating properly, or if not, that any respect in which it was not operating properly or was out of operation was not such as to affect the production of the output or the accuracy of its contents.

(2) For the purpose of deciding whether or not such output is so admissible, the court may draw any reasonable inference from the circumstances in which the output was made or otherwise came into being.

(3) The Minister may make rules requiring that, in any proceedings where it is desired to give a statement in evidence by virtue of this section, such information concerning the statement as may be required by the rules shall be provided in such form and at such time as may be so required.

### Supplementary provisions on evidence

12\.—(1) In any proceedings where it is desired to admit computer output in evidence in accordance with section 11, a certificate —

(a) identifying the computer output and describing the manner in which it was produced;

(b) giving such particulars of any device involved in the production of that computer output as may be appropriate for the purpose of showing that the output was produced by a computer;

(c) dealing with any of the matters mentioned in section 11(1); and

(d) purporting to be signed by a person occupying a responsible position in relation to the operation of the computer at all relevant times,

shall be admitted in those proceedings as evidence of anything stated in the certificate.

(2) If the person referred to in subsection (1)(d) who occupies a responsible position in relation to the operation of the computer did not have control or access over any relevant records and facts in relation to the production by the computer of the computer output, a supplementary certificate signed by another person who had such control or access and made in accordance with subsection (1)(a) to (c) shall be evidence of anything stated in the certificate.

(3) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), it shall be sufficient for a matter to be stated to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person stating it.

(4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) or (2), a court may require oral evidence to be given of anything of which evidence could be given by a certificate under that subsection.

(5) Any person who in a certificate tendered under subsection (1) or (2) in a court makes a statement which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

(6) In estimating the weight, if any, of any admissible computer output, regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the output and, in particular —

(a) to the question whether or not the information which the output reproduces or is derived from was supplied to the relevant computer, or recorded for the purpose of being supplied to it, contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts dealt with in that information; and

(b) to the question whether or not any person concerned with the supply of information to that computer, or with the operation of that computer or any equipment by means of which the admissible computer output was produced by it, had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.

authenticated in such manner as the court may approve.

### Powers of police officer to investigate and require assistance

14\. In connection with the exercise of his powers of investigations under the Criminal Procedure Code [Cap. 68], a police officer —

(a) shall be entitled at any time to have access to, and inspect and check the operation of, any computer and any associated apparatus or material which he has reasonable cause to suspect is or has been in use in connection with any offence under this Act; and
