(a) either of the following applies:

(i) the relevant telecommunication licensee is licensed to operate a telecommunication system, or any installation or plant used for telecommunications, that is so costly or difficult to replicate that a requirement to do so would create a significant barrier to rapid and successful entry into the market for telecommunication services in Singapore by an efficient competitor of the relevant telecommunication licensee;
