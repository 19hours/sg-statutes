[4/2003 wef 01/04/2003]

(2) Every Deputy Director-General of Customs and Assistant Director-General of Customs shall be an Assistant Comptroller of Entertainments Duty and shall have all the powers conferred upon the Comptroller by this Act or any rules made thereunder.

[4/2003 wef 01/04/2003]

(3) The Minister may appoint a deputy or deputies to the Comptroller either generally for the purposes of this Act or of any rules made thereunder or for the purposes of particular provisions of this Act or for the purposes of particular rules made under this Act.

### Duties

4\.—(1) There shall be charged, levied and paid to the Comptroller upon every payment for admission to any entertainment (excluding goods and services tax charged thereon) a duty (referred to in this Act as entertainments duty) at such rate or rates as may be prescribed by the Minister by order published in theGazette.

[Act 31/93 wef 26/11/1993 vide S 466/93]

(2) The Minister may impose different rates in respect of different classes of entertainments.

(3) The Comptroller may in his discretion accept in respect of any entertainment a lump sum by way of composition for and in lieu of entertainments duty in any case where by reason of the smallness of the sum likely to be payable, or difficulty in computing such sum, he considers it expedient to do so.

(4) The Comptroller shall pay all moneys collected under the provisions of this Act into the Consolidated Fund.

(5) Without prejudice to any other remedy, any entertainments duty payable under this Act may be sued for and recovered in a court of competent jurisdiction by the Comptroller in his official name as a debt due to the Government.

(6) Any order made by the Minister under subsection (1) shall be presented to Parliament as soon as possible after publication.

### Comptroller may decide what is a payment for admission

5\.—(1) If any payment other than a payment for admission (upon which duty is payable under the provisions of this Act) is required or accepted by the proprietor of an entertainment from any person, the Comptroller shall decide whether all or any proportion of that payment is in the nature of a payment for admission, and if he so decides entertainments duty shall be paid upon that payment or proportion of payment either in accordance with section 4(2) or (3) or otherwise as the Comptroller may require.

(2) Any person dissatisfied with the decision of the Comptroller under subsection (1) may appeal to the Minister whose decision shall be final.

### Payment of duty, how made

6\.—(1) Entertainments duty shall be levied, paid and collected by such method or methods, whether by way of a stamp upon or affixed to any ticket of admission denoting that the proper entertainments duty has been paid or otherwise, as may be prescribed by rules made under this Act.

(2) Unless otherwise provided, if any person is admitted on payment to an entertainment and entertainments duty is not levied, paid and collected in accordance with the provisions of this Act or any rules made thereunder, the proprietor of the entertainment to which he is admitted shall be guilty of an offence.

(3) The Comptroller may require the proprietor of any entertainment to lodge with the Comptroller such security as the Comptroller may consider appropriate for the payment of entertainments duty.

### Duty chargeable in respect of every person

7\. Entertainments duty shall be chargeable in respect of every person admitted to an entertainment for payment and, in the case of admission by stamped ticket, shall be paid by means of the stamp on the ticket. In the case of admission otherwise than by stamped ticket, it shall, unless the Comptroller in exercise of the powers conferred by section 4(2) or (3) directs otherwise, be calculated and paid on the number of admissions.

### Recovery of duties

8\. Entertainments duty, in the case of admission otherwise than by stamped ticket, shall be recoverable from the proprietor as a civil debt due to the Government.

### Refund of duty overpaid

9\. It shall be lawful for the Comptroller, if it is proved to his satisfaction that any money has been overpaid as entertainments duty under this Act, to direct the refund of the money so overpaid:

Provided that no such refund shall be allowed unless a claim in respect thereof is made within 6 months of the overpayment.

### Duty not paid, short paid, or erroneously refunded

10\. Whenever for any reason entertainments duty payable under this Act has not been paid, or has been short paid, or the whole or any part of the entertainments duty, after having been paid, has, owing to any cause, been erroneously refunded, the person liable to pay such duty, or the person to whom the refund has been erroneously made, as the case may be, shall pay the entertainments duty not paid or short paid, or the amount erroneously refunded to him, on demand being made by the Comptroller, within 6 months of the date of the non-payment, or short payment, or erroneous refund, as the case may be, without prejudice to any other remedy for the recovery of the amount unpaid or erroneously refunded.

### Duty on subscription and season tickets

11\.—(1) Where the payment for admission to an entertainment is made by means of a lump sum paid —

(a) as a subscription or contribution to any club, association or society;

(b) for a season ticket; or

(c) for the right of admission to a series of entertainments or to any entertainment during a certain period of time,

the entertainments duty shall be paid on the amount of the lump sum.

(2) If the Comptroller is of the opinion that the payment of a lump sum or of any payment for a ticket includes other privileges, rights or purposes besides the admission to an entertainment, the duty shall be charged on such amount as appears to the Comptroller to represent the right of admission to entertainments in respect of which entertainments duty is payable.

(3) Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Comptroller under subsection (2) may appeal to the Minister whose decision shall be final.

### Exemption from duty for charities, etc.

12\.—(1) Entertainments duty shall not be charged for admission to any entertainment if —
