(7) In the case of goods imported under a contract of sale and about to be removed from customs control for use in Singapore, duty shall be deemed to have been paid on their value, if, before the goods are delivered from a Government warehouse, licensed factory warehouse or licensed warehouse for home use, duty is tendered, accepted and paid on a declared value based on the contract price.

(8) For the purpose of subsection (7) —

(a) the declared value of any goods shall be their value as declared by or on behalf of the importer in making the goods available for home use;

(b) that value shall be deemed to be based on the contract price if, but only if, it represents the price properly adjusted to take account of circumstances differentiating the contract from such a contract of sale as is contemplated by subsections (1) to (6); and

### Value of motor spirit which is uncustomed, not retailed in Singapore under a trade name or where the retailers’ pump price is not available
