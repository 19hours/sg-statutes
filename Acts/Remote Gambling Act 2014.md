unless excluded by the Minister by an order published in theGazette.

(b) the publication in a telephone directory of the name of a person who provides a remote gambling service unless —

(ii) the entry for the person contains a link to an online location for the person that relates to the remote gambling service;

(c) an index of online search results which links or refers an end‑user in Singapore to remote gambling services or facilities for the access or use of remote gambling services, which is made available to that person only because that person initiates a search through an online information location service, such as but not limited to a search engine service;

(d) any other activity specified or described by the Minister in an order published in theGazette.
