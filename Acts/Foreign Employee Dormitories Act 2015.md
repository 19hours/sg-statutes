### Modification of conditions of licence

12\.—(1) Subject to this section, it is lawful for the Commissioner to modify the conditions of a licence without compensating the licensed operator concerned.

(2) Before modifying any conditions of a licence, the Commissioner must, unless subsection (5) applies, give notice to the licensed operator holding that licence —

(b) specifying the time (being not less than 14 days from the date of service of notice on the licensed operator) within which the licensed operator may make written representations to the Commissioner with respect to the proposed modification.

(3) Upon receiving any written representation referred to in subsection (2), the Commissioner must consider that representation and may —

(b) the Commissioner amends any proposed modification to the conditions of the licence under subsection (3)(b); or

(c) no written representation is received by the Commissioner within the time specified in subsection (2)(b), or any written representation made under that subsection is subsequently withdrawn, and the licensed operator has not given immediate effect to the modification,

the Commissioner is to issue a direction in writing to the licensed operator in question requiring the licensed operator, within the time specified by the Commissioner, to give effect to the modification as specified in the notice under subsection (2) or as amended by the Commissioner under subsection (3), as the case may be.

(5) However, where the Commissioner considers that it is impracticable or undesirable, in the circumstances of the particular case because of danger or risk to the security and good order within, or to the safety and health of the residents of, a foreign employee dormitory for him or her to give notice under subsection (2) before modifying the conditions of a particular licence, the Commissioner may, without compensating the licensed operator concerned, and by giving notice to that licensed operator, modify the conditions of the particular licence with immediate effect.

(6) The licensed operator whose licence conditions have been modified with immediate effect under subsection (5) may, within 7 days after the Commissioner has given notice under subsection (5), apply to the Commissioner to review his or her decision.

(7) On reviewing his or her decision under subsection (6), the Commissioner may —

(a) confirm his or her decision; or

(b) delete or vary the modified licence condition, or reinstate the licence condition without modification, with effect from such date specified, without compensating the licensed operator concerned,

and there is to be no further review.

(8) An application to review the Commissioner’s decision does not affect the operation of the decision under subsection (5) or prevent the taking of action to implement that decision, and unless otherwise allowed by the Commissioner, the decision to be reviewed must be complied with unless the determination of the review indicates otherwise.

### Compliance directives

13\.—(1) The Commissioner may (without compensation) give a compliance directive if the Commissioner —

(a) considers that the duties imposed by or under this Act in connection with the management of the business of operating boarding premises as a foreign employee dormitory, or the operations of a foreign employee dormitory, are being carried out in a careless or incompetent manner;

(b) is satisfied that a licensed operator has contravened or failed to comply with any condition of the licensed operator’s licence, or any code of practice or standard of performance applicable to the licensed operator, and that the contravention or non‑compliance may be rectified; or

(i) that there is a serious and imminent threat or risk to the safety and health of the residents of any boarding premises specified in a licence; or

(ii) that the occurrence within or outside Singapore of any civil unrest, hostilities, war, election or other event (whether or not of a similar kind) may occasion disorder within any boarding premises specified in a licence, or cause feelings of ill‑will or hostility between, by or with such residents,

and that a compliance directive is appropriate or requisite to avoid any actual or imminent occurrence that endangers the safety or health of those residents, to prevent disorder or preserve the safety of those residents, or to avoid serious disruptions to the community in the vicinity of any boarding premises specified in a licence, as the case may be.

(2) A compliance directive may be given to either or both the following:

(a) a licensed operator in respect of any boarding premises specified in its licence;

(b) the proprietor of the boarding premises operated as a foreign employee dormitory by a licensed operator where the Commissioner receives a statutory declaration from the licensed operator under subsection (7) and is satisfied that compliance by the licensed operator with the compliance directive requires the permission or other co‑operation of that proprietor.

(3) A compliance directive given under subsection (1) —

(5) Every licensed operator or proprietor of a foreign employee dormitory must comply with every compliance directive given under this section to the licensed operator or proprietor, as the case may be, as soon as it takes effect.

(6) Without prejudice to the right of the Commissioner to exercise the powers under subsection (8) —

(a) the licensed operator of a foreign employee dormitory who, without reasonable excuse, contravenes or fails to comply with a requirement imposed by a compliance directive given to the licensed operator (whether or not the same directive is also given to a proprietor); or

(b) the proprietor of a foreign employee dormitory who, without reasonable excuse, contravenes or fails to comply with a requirement imposed by a compliance directive given to the proprietor (whether or not the same directive is also given to a licensed operator),

shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $10,000 for each day or part thereof the offence continues after conviction.

(7) A licensed operator given a compliance directive to demolish, renovate or otherwise alter any part of the premises specified in the licence of the licensed operator may, within 7 days after receiving the directive, provide the Commissioner a statutory declaration stating —

(a) a statement that by reason of any arrangements (by contract or otherwise) with the proprietor of the boarding premises operated as a foreign employee dormitory, the licensed operator is not entitled to do, or to refrain from doing, such things as are specified or described in the compliance directive, and describing those arrangements; and

(b) the name and address of the proprietor.

(8) If a compliance directive is not complied with to his or her satisfaction, the Commissioner may carry out or cause to be carried out all or any of the repairs, work or alteration specified in that directive, and recover (as a debt due to the Government) all expenses reasonably incurred by him or her in the exercise of powers under this subsection from the licensed operator or the proprietor of a foreign employee dormitory in default.

(9) It shall not be necessary to publish any compliance directive given under this section in theGazette, or for the Commissioner to provide a licensed operator or proprietor reasonable opportunity to be heard before giving the licensed operator or proprietor a compliance directive.
