Countervailing Duties

### Imposition of countervailing duties

3\.—(1) The Minister may impose a countervailing duty on the subject goods imported into Singapore where he determines —

(a) that a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject goods; and

(b) that injury is found to exist in any one of the following ways:

(i) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, causing material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods;

(ii) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods; or

(iii) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, causing material retardation of the establishment of the domestic industry in Singapore.

(2) The amount of countervailing duty to be imposed —

(a) shall be equal to the countervailable subsidy determined to be provided with respect to the subject goods; or

(b) if the Minister determines that a lower countervailing duty is sufficient to eliminate the injury determined in subsection (1)(b), shall be such lower duty.

(3) For the purposes of this section —

(a) it must be demonstrated that the subject goods are causing injury within the meaning of this Act;

(b) the demonstration of a causal relationship between the subject goods and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence before the Minister;

(c) the Minister shall also examine any known factors other than the subject goods which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the subject goods.

(4) Where the country of origin of the subject goods is a non-market economy country, the countervailable subsidy and countervailing duty shall be determined in the prescribed manner.

### Initiation of investigation

4\.—(1) A written petition requesting that a countervailing duty investigation be initiated with regard to goods imported, or likely to be imported, into Singapore may be submitted to the Minister by any person on behalf of the domestic industry producing like goods.

(2) A petition shall be in such form as may be determined by the Minister and shall include evidence of each of the elements specified in section 3(1) and all other evidence that may be prescribed.

(3) The Minister shall, within the period prescribed, review the petition and other available information and determine whether —

(a) sufficient evidence to warrant the initiation of an investigation into whether the elements necessary for the imposition of a countervailing duty as provided under section 3(1) exists; and

(b) such an investigation is in the public interest.

(4) Where the Minister determines that sufficient evidence does not exist to warrant the initiation of a countervailing duty investigation or that such an investigation is not in the public interest, the Minister shall as soon as practicable notify the petitioner of his determination not to initiate an investigation.

(5) Where the Minister determines that sufficient evidence exists to warrant the initiation of a countervailing duty investigation and that such an investigation is in the public interest, the Minister shall notify the appropriate interested parties and publish a notice of initiation of investigation.

(6) The Minister may, in special circumstances, initiate a countervailing duty investigation on his own accord where he has sufficient evidence of each of the elements specified in section 3(1).

(7) Where the Minister decides to initiate an investigation under subsection (6), he shall notify the appropriate interested parties and publish a notice of initiation of investigation.

(8) Notwithstanding any provision in this section, the Minister shall not initiate an investigation unless he has determined on the basis of an examination of the degree of support for, or opposition to, any written petition submitted under subsection (1) —

(a) that the written petition is supported by domestic producers of like goods whose collective output constitutes more than 50% of the total production of the like goods produced by that portion of the domestic industry expressing either support for or opposition to the written petition; and

(b) that the domestic producers of like goods expressly supporting the written petition account for not less than 25% of the total production of the like goods produced by the domestic industry.

(9) For the purposes of subsection (8), in the case of fragmented industries involving an exceptionally large number of producers, the Minister may determine the support and opposition by using statistically valid sampling techniques.

### Preliminary determination of subsidy and injury

7\.—(1) The Minister shall, within such period as may be prescribed, make a preliminary determination regarding —

(a) whether a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject goods, and the amount of such countervailable subsidy; and

(i) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, causing material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods;

(ii) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods; or

(iii) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, causing material retardation of the establishment of the domestic industry in Singapore.

(a) the affirmative preliminary determination stating the reasons for his determination under subsection (1)(a) and (b); and

(b) the provisional measures applicable.

### Provisional measures

8\.—(1) The Minister shall apply provisional measures with regard to the subject goods imported into Singapore on or after the publication of the notice of affirmative preliminary determination where the Minister determines that such measures are necessary to prevent the injury referred to in section 7(1)(b) from occurring during the period of investigation.

(2) Provisional measures shall not be imposed sooner than 60 days from the date of initiation of the investigation.

(3) Provisional measures shall take the form of a provisional duty or a security equal to the amount of the estimated countervailable subsidy determined under section 7(1).

(ii) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods; or

(iii) the subject goods are, through the effects of the subsidy, causing material retardation of the establishment of the domestic industry in Singapore.

(2) Where the Minister makes a negative final determination under subsection (1), he shall —

(a) terminate the investigation;

(b) terminate any provisional measures applied under section 8 and refund any provisional duty paid and release any security required by such measures; and

(c) publish a notice of the negative final determination stating the reasons therefor.

(3) Where the Minister makes an affirmative final determination under subsection (1), he shall —

(a) publish a notice of the affirmative final determination stating the reasons therefor, the countervailing duties applicable and the subject goods on which the countervailing duties apply;

(b) impose countervailing duties in accordance with section 3(2) on the subject goods imported into Singapore on or after the date of publication of the affirmative final determination; and

(c) impose countervailing duties in accordance with subsections (5) and (6) on imports into Singapore for which provisional measures were applied.

(4) Where an affirmative final determination has been made, the Minister may take into consideration public interest in determining whether to impose countervailing duties and the amount of such duties.

(5) The Minister shall impose countervailing duties on the subject goods against which provisional measures were applied if the Minister —

(a) makes a determination of material injury under subsection (1)(b)(i); or

(b) makes a determination of threat of material injury under subsection (1)(b)(ii) and finds that the import of the subject goods, in the absence of the provisional measures, would have led to a finding of material injury under subsection (1)(b)(i).

(6) With respect to the imposition of any countervailing duty under subsection (5) —

(a) where the countervailing duty is higher than the provisional duty or the amount guaranteed by the security required under the provisional measures, only the amount equal to the provisional duty or the security given shall be imposed; and

(b) where the countervailing duty is less than the provisional duty or the amount guaranteed by the security required under the provisional measures, the full amount of the countervailing duty shall be imposed and the excess provisional duty paid or security given shall be reimbursed or released.

(7) Where no countervailing duties are imposed under subsection (5) on the subject goods against which the provisional measures were applied, the Minister shall refund the provisional duty paid and release the security required by the provisional measures.

(8) Notwithstanding subsections (3) and (5), the Minister may impose countervailing duties on the subject goods imported into Singapore within a period of 90 days prior to the application of provisional measures, but in no case earlier than the date of initiation of the investigation, if —

(a) the Minister finds injury that is difficult to repair;

(b) such injury is being caused by massive imports of the subject goods in a relatively short period of time and the Minister considers the retroactive imposition of duties necessary to preclude the recurrence of such injury; and

(c) countervailable subsidies are being provided with respect to the subject goods in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.

(9) When a countervailing duty is imposed on the subject goods, such countervailing duty shall, as provided in the regulations, be imposed in the appropriate amount on a non-discriminatory basis on all imports of such goods into Singapore from the country found to be subsidising the subject goods.

### Termination of investigation

10\.—(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act but subject to subsection (2), an investigation may be terminated at any time if —

(a) the petitioner withdraws the petition; or

(b) the Minister determines that such termination is in the public interest.

(2) An investigation shall be terminated immediately if the Minister determines that the amount of countervailable subsidy is de minimis or that the volume of subsidised imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible.

(3) For the purpose of subsection (2) —

(a) the amount of countervailable subsidy shall be considered to be de minimis if the amount is less than the prescribed percentage, expressed as an ad valorem percentage; and

(b) the volume of subsidised imports shall be regarded as negligible if the volume of subsidised imports from a particular country is found to account for less than the prescribed percentage of the imports of the like goods into Singapore.

(4) If a termination under subsection (1) or (2) occurs prior to the preliminary determination, the Minister shall publish a notice of such termination stating the reasons therefor.

(5) If a termination under subsection (1) or (2) occurs after the preliminary determination, the Minister shall —

(6) Where the Minister completes the investigation under subsection (4) or for any other reason, and makes a negative determination, the undertakings shall lapse, except in circumstances referred to in subsection (7).

(7) Where the negative determination referred to in subsection (6) is due in large part to the existence of the undertakings, the undertakings may be maintained subject to the provisions of this Act.

(8) The Minister may take any action under subsection (9) or (10) at any time if he determines that —

(a) the undertakings accepted under subsection (1) no longer meet the requirements of subsection (2); or

## PART III

ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES

### Imposition of anti-dumping duties

14\.—(1) The Minister may impose an anti-dumping duty on the subject goods imported into Singapore where he determines —

(a) that the export price of the subject goods is less than the normal value; and

(b) that injury is found to exist in any one of the following ways:

(i) the subject goods are, through the effects of dumping, causing material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods;

(ii) the subject goods are, through the effects of dumping, threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods; or

(iii) the subject goods are, through the effects of dumping, causing material retardation of the establishment of the domestic industry in Singapore.

(2) The amount of anti-dumping duty to be imposed —

(a) shall be equal to the dumping margin determined to exist with respect to the subject goods; or

(b) if the Minister determines that a lower anti-dumping duty will be sufficient to eliminate the injury determined in subsection (1)(b), shall be such lower duty.

(3) For the purposes of this section —

(a) it must be demonstrated that the subject goods are causing injury within the meaning of this Act;

(b) the demonstration of a causal relationship between the subject goods and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence before the Minister;

(c) the Minister shall also examine any known factors other than the subject goods which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the subject goods.

### Normal value

15\.—(1) For the purpose of this Act, the normal value of any subject goods shall be the comparable price actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade for like goods sold for consumption in the domestic market of the exporting country.

(2) Where there are no sales in the domestic market of the exporting country under subsection (1), or where, because of the particular market situation or the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the subject goods shall be either —

(a) the comparable price actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade for like goods exported to any appropriate third country, provided that such price is representative; or

(b) the constructed value of the subject goods which shall include the cost of production in the exporting country, plus a reasonable amount for profits.

(3) For the purpose of subsection (2), sales of like goods destined for consumption in the domestic market of the exporting country or the appropriate third country shall normally be considered a sufficient quantity for the determination of the normal value if such sales constitute 5% or more of the sales of the subject goods to Singapore, except that a lower ratio shall be acceptable where the evidence shows that domestic sales at such lower ratio are of sufficient magnitude to provide for a proper comparison.

(4) Sales of the like goods in the domestic market of the exporting country or sales to a third country at prices below per unit cost of production may be treated as not being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price and may be disregarded in determining normal value only if the Minister determines that such sales are made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities and are at prices which do not provide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time.

(5) For the purpose of determining the cost of production referred to in subsections (2)(b) and (4), the cost of production shall be computed on the basis of all fixed and variable costs of manufacturing for sale in the exporting country plus a reasonable amount for selling, administrative and other general expenses.

(6) In the circumstances described in subsection (4), the normal value of any subject goods may be determined on the basis of —

(a) the remaining sales in the domestic market made at a price which is not less than the cost of production, provided that such remaining sales are in sufficient quantities; or

(b) where the sale does not exist in sufficient quantities in the domestic market, the remaining sales in the third country market made at a price which is not less than the cost of production, provided that such remaining sales are in sufficient quantities.

(7) Where the remaining sales are not in sufficient quantities for the calculation of normal value under subsection (6), the normal value of any subject goods may be determined on the basis of the constructed value as described in subsection (2)(b).

### Export price

16\.—(1) The export price of any subject goods shall be the price actually paid or payable for the subject goods.

(2) Where there is no export price, or where there is an association or a compensatory arrangement between the exporter and the importer or a third party and it appears that the price actually paid or payable for the subject goods is unreliable, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price at which the subject goods are first resold to an independent buyer or, if the subject goods are not resold to an independent buyer or not resold in the condition imported, on any reasonable basis.

(3) If the export price is constructed as described in subsection (2), allowance shall be made for all costs incurred between importation and resale.

### Comparison of normal value and export price

(3) Subject to subsections (1) and (2), the existence of the margin of dumping shall, unless otherwise provided by regulations, normally be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of prices of all comparable export transactions of the subject goods.

### Subject goods from non-market economy country

18\. Where the country of origin of any subject goods is a non-market economy country, the normal value of the subject goods shall be determined in the prescribed manner.

### Initiation of investigation

19\.—(1) A written petition requesting that an anti-dumping duty investigation be initiated with regard to goods imported, or likely to be imported, into Singapore may be submitted to the Minister by any person on behalf of the domestic industry producing like goods.

(3) The Minister shall, within the period prescribed, review the petition and other available information and determine whether —

(a) sufficient evidence to warrant the initiation of an investigation into whether the elements necessary for the imposition of an anti-dumping duty as provided under section 14(1) exists; and

(b) such an investigation is in the public interest.

(4) Where the Minister determines that sufficient evidence does not exist to warrant the initiation of an anti-dumping duty investigation or that such an investigation is not in the public interest, the Minister shall as soon as practicable notify the petitioner of his determination not to initiate an investigation.

(a) that the written petition is supported by domestic producers of like goods whose collective output constitutes more than 50% of the total production of the like goods produced by that portion of the domestic industry expressing either support for or opposition to the written petition; and

(b) that the domestic producers of like goods expressly supporting the written petition account for not less than 25% of the total production of the like goods produced by the domestic industry.

(9) For the purposes of subsection (8), in the case of fragmented industries involving an exceptionally large number of producers, the Minister may determine the support and opposition by using statistically valid sampling techniques.

20\. All anti-dumping duty investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded by the Minister within one year, and in no case more than 18 months after initiation.

### Preliminary determination of dumping and injury

21\.—(1) The Minister shall, within such period as may be prescribed, make a preliminary determination regarding —

(i) the subject goods are, through the effects of dumping, causing material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods;

(ii) the subject goods are, through the effects of dumping, threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry in Singapore producing like goods; or

(iii) the subject goods are, through the effects of dumping, causing material retardation of the establishment of the domestic industry in Singapore.

(3) If the Minister makes an affirmative preliminary determination under subsection (1), he shall continue the investigation and publish a notice of —

(a) the affirmative preliminary determination stating the reasons for his determination under subsection (1)(a) and (b); and

(b) the provisional measures applicable.

22\.—(1) The Minister shall apply provisional measures with regard to the subject goods imported into Singapore on or after the publication of the notice of affirmative preliminary determination where the Minister determines that such measures are necessary to prevent the injury referred to in section 21(1)(b) from occurring during the period of investigation.

(2) Provisional measures shall not be imposed sooner than 60 days from the date of initiation of the investigation.

(3) Provisional measures shall take the form of a provisional duty or a security equal to the amount of the estimated dumping margin determined under section 21(1).

### Final determination of dumping and injury

23\.—(1) The Minister shall, within such period as may be prescribed, make a final determination regarding —

(a) publish a notice of the affirmative final determination stating the reasons therefor, the anti-dumping duties applicable and the subject goods on which the anti-dumping duties apply;

(b) impose anti-dumping duties in the amounts determined in the final determination in accordance with section 14(2) on the subject goods imported into Singapore on or after the date of publication of the final determination; and

(c) impose anti-dumping duties in accordance with subsections (5) and (6) on imports into Singapore for which provisional measures were applied.

(4) Where an affirmative final determination has been made, the Minister may take into consideration public interest in determining whether to impose anti-dumping duties and the amount of such duties.

(5) The Minister shall impose anti-dumping duties on the subject goods against which provisional measures were applied if the Minister —

(a) makes a determination of material injury under subsection (1)(b)(i); or

(b) makes a determination of threat of material injury under subsection (1)(b)(ii) and finds that the import of the subject goods, in the absence of the provisional measures, would have led to a finding of material injury under subsection (1)(b)(i).

(6) With respect to the imposition of any anti-dumping duty under subsection (5) —

(a) where the anti-dumping duty is higher than the provisional duty or the amount guaranteed by the security required under the provisional measures, only the amount equal to the provisional duty or the security given shall be imposed; and

(b) where the anti-dumping duty is less than the provisional duty or the amount guaranteed by the security required under the provisional measures, the full amount of the anti-dumping duty shall be imposed and the excess amount of the provisional duty paid or security given shall be reimbursed or released.

(8) Notwithstanding subsections (3) and (5), the Minister may impose anti-dumping duties on the subject goods imported into Singapore within a period of 90 days prior to the application of provisional measures, but in no case earlier than the date of the initiation of the investigation, if —

(a) there is a history of dumping which caused injury, or the importer was or should have been aware that the exporter practises dumping and that such dumping would cause injury; and

(b) the injury is caused by massive dumped imports of the subject goods in a relatively short period of time which in the light of the timing and the volume of such imports and other circumstances (such as a rapid build-up of inventories of the subject goods) is likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed.

(9) When an anti-dumping duty is imposed on the subject goods, such anti-dumping duty shall be imposed in the appropriate amount as provided by regulations made under this Act.

### Termination of investigation

(a) the petitioner withdraws the petition; or

(b) the Minister determines that such termination is in the public interest.

(2) An investigation shall be terminated immediately if the Minister determines that the margin of dumping is de minimis or that the volume of imports of the subject goods, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible.

(3) For the purpose of subsection (2) —

(a) the margin of dumping shall be considered to be de minimis if the margin is less than 2%, expressed as a percentage of the export price; and

(b) the volume of imports of the subject goods shall normally be regarded as negligible if the volume of imports of the subject goods from a particular country is found to account for less than 3% of imports of the like goods into Singapore, unless the subject goods from countries which individually account for less than 3% of imports of the like goods in Singapore collectively account for more than 7% of imports of the like goods into Singapore.

(4) If a termination under subsection (1) or (2) occurs prior to the preliminary determination, the Minister shall publish a notice of such termination stating the reasons therefor.

(8) The Minister may take any action under subsection (9) or (10) at any time if he determines that —

(a) the undertakings accepted under subsection (1) no longer meet the requirements of subsection (2); or
