(2) An accused person shall, for the purposes of subsection (1), be deemed to be in possession of resources or property or to have obtained an accretion thereto where those resources or property are held or the accretion is obtained by any other person whom, having regard to his relationship to the accused person or to any other circumstances, there is reason to believe to be holding those resources or property or to have obtained the accretion in trust for or on behalf of the accused person or as a gift from the accused person.

Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in section 23, be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body.

25\. Any person who —
