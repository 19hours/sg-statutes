(b) the Comptroller may, by notice of sale to be served or published in the prescribed manner, declare his intention of selling, at the expiration of 3 months from the date of the notice of sale, the premises in respect of which the arrears are due and, if, at the expiration of that period, the arrears have not been paid or satisfied, the Comptroller may sell by public auction, in lots or otherwise, the whole of such premises or such portion thereof or such interest therein as he considers sufficient for the recovery of the arrears and costs.

(2) Any tenant, sub-tenant or occupier who, in order to avoid the seizure or sale of his property for non-payment of arrears payable by the owner of the premises, pays the arrears and costs may thereafter, in the absence of any written agreement to the contrary, deduct the amount so paid by him from the rent due or to become due by him to his immediate landlord on account of the premises or such part thereof as is held or occupied by him, and may retain possession thereof until that amount has been fully reimbursed to him whether by deduction from the rent or otherwise.
