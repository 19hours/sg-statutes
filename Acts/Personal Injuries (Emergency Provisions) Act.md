(b) caused by the impact on any person or property of any enemy aircraft, or any aircraft belonging to, or held by any person on behalf of or for the benefit of Her Majesty or any allied power, or any part of, or anything dropped from, any such aircraft;

“war service injury”, in relation to a civil defence volunteer, means any physical injury which the Authority certifies to have been shown to his satisfaction to have arisen out of and in the course of the performance by the volunteer of his duties as a member of the civil defence organisation to which he belonged at the time when the injury was sustained, and (except in the case of a war injury) not to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment in any other capacity.

[S (NS) 179/59]

(2) No certificate shall be given by the Authority in relation to the definition of “war service injury” in subsection (1), unless he has been furnished with a report about the injury in question by a responsible officer of the civil defence organisation of which the volunteer concerned was a member at the time when the injury was sustained and any such certificate may be revoked by the Authority at any time on new facts being brought to his notice.

### Appointment of Authority

3\.—(1) The President may appoint an Authority for the purposes of this Act.

[S (NS) 179/59]

(2) Such appointment may be made by name or office and, if made by office, shall relate to any officer who at the time of the appointment or thereafter is performing the duties of that office.

### Allowances and pensions in respect of certain war injuries and war service injuries

4\.—(1) The President may make a scheme in accordance with the provisions of this Act providing for the making of payments in respect of the following injuries sustained during the period of the emergency:

(a) war injuries sustained by gainfully occupied persons (with such exceptions, if any, as may be specified in the scheme) and by persons of such other classes as may be so specified; and

(b) war service injuries sustained by civil defence volunteers.

[S (NS) 178/59]

(2) In respect of any such injury, a scheme may authorise the Authority, in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the scheme, to make the following payments to or in respect of the person injured:

(a) payments by way of allowance (referred to in this Act as injury allowances), which shall be payable only so long as the person injured is incapacitated for work by the injury and has not received any such payment as is mentioned in paragraph (b); and

(b) payments by way of pension or grant, which shall be payable only where the injury causes serious and prolonged disablement or death.

(3) A scheme may empower the Authority to make regulations for giving effect to the purposes of the scheme.

(4) Any decision of the Authority as to the making, refusal or amount, or as to the continuance or discontinuance, of a payment under a scheme may be varied by a subsequent decision of the Authority or of the President, but except in so far as it is so varied shall be final and conclusive.

[S (NS) 178/59]

### Relief from liability to pay compensation or damages

6\.—(1) In respect of a war injury sustained during the period of the emergency by any person, and in respect of a war service injury sustained during that period by a civil defence volunteer, no such compensation or damages shall be payable, whether to the person injured or to any other person, as apart from the provisions of this subsection —

(a) would be payable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act; or

(b) would, whether by virtue of any written law, by virtue of any contract, or at common law, be payable —

(i) in the case of a war injury, by any person; or

(ii) in the case of a war service injury sustained by a civil defence volunteer, by the employer of the volunteer, by any person who has any responsibility in connection with his duties as a volunteer or by any other civil defence volunteer,

on the ground that the injury in question was attributable to some negligence, nuisance or breach of duty for which the person by whom the compensation or damages would be payable is responsible.

(2) The failure to give a notice or make a claim or commence proceedings within the time required by any written law shall not be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings in respect of any personal injury, if —

(a) an application for a payment under a scheme, or under any other written law or instrument, has been duly made to the Authority in respect of the injury;

(b) the court before which the proceedings are brought is satisfied that the application was made in the reasonable belief that the injury was such that a payment could be made under the scheme or that other written law or instrument, as the case may be;

(c) the Authority certifies that the application was rejected, or that payments made in pursuance of the application were discontinued, on the ground that the injury was not such an injury; and

(d) the proceedings are commenced within one month from the date of the certificate of the Authority.

### Reduction of sick pay by amount of allowances

7\. Where an employee —

(a) is in receipt of an injury allowance under a scheme during a period for which he is incapacitated for work; and

(b) would, but for this section, be entitled to receive a sum from his employer by way of wages or other emoluments in respect of that period,

the employer shall be under no obligation to pay to him in respect of that period an amount greater than the amount by which that sum exceeds that allowance.

### Information as to earnings

8\.—(1) Where it is necessary, in order to determine the amount of any payment to be awarded under a scheme in respect of any injury, to ascertain the earnings of the person injured in respect of any period before he sustained the injury, the Authority may by notice in writing require —

(a) any person who was an employer of the injured person during that period; and

(b) any other person having any knowledge with respect to the financial circumstances of the injured person during that period,

to furnish in accordance with the notice any information in his possession relating to those earnings or circumstances, and to produce to any person specified in the notice any wage books, records or other documents in his possession containing any entries with respect to those earnings.

(2) If any person —

(a) fails to comply with the requirements of any such notice; or

(b) in purported compliance with any such notice, knowingly or recklessly makes any untrue statement or untrue representation, or produces any document which is false in a material particular or calculated to deceive,

he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $250.

### Penalty for false statement

9\. Any person who, for the purpose of obtaining a payment under a scheme, either for himself or for any other person, knowingly makes any untrue statement or untrue representation, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months.

### Assignments, etc., to be void

10\. Any assignment of, or charge on, and any agreement to assign or charge, any payment awarded or to be awarded under a scheme shall be void, and, on the bankruptcy of any person to whom such a payment has been awarded, the payment shall not pass to the Official Assignee or other person acting on behalf of the creditors.
