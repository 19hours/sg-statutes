### Accommodation works

13\.—(1) Every railway administration shall make and maintain the following works for the accommodation of the owners and occupiers of lands adjoining the railway:

(a) such and so many convenient crossings, bridges, arches, culverts and passages over, under or by the sides of or leading to or from the railway, as are in the opinion of the Minister necessary for the purpose of making good any interruptions caused by the railway to the use of the lands through which the railway is made;

(b) all necessary arches, tunnels, culverts, drains, water-courses or other passages over or under or by the sides of the railway of such dimensions as will, in the opinion of the Minister, be sufficient at all times to convey water as freely from or to the lands lying near or by the railway as before the making of the railway or as nearly so as may be.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the works specified in subsection (1)(a) and (b) shall be made during or immediately after the laying out or formation of the railway over the lands traversed thereby, and in such manner as to cause as little damage or inconvenience as possible to persons interested in the lands or affected by the works.

### Provisos

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) shall be subject to the following provisos:

(a) a railway administration shall not be required to make any accommodation works in such a manner as would prevent or obstruct the working or using of the railway, or to make any accommodation works with respect to which the owners and occupiers of the land have agreed to receive and have been paid compensation in consideration of their not requiring the works to be made;

(b) subject to the provisions of this Act, a railway administration shall not be compelled to defray the cost of executing any further or additional accommodation works for the use of the owners or occupiers of the lands after the expiration of 10 years from the date on which the railway passing through the lands was first opened for public traffic;

(c) where a railway administration has provided suitable accommodation for the crossing of a road or stream, and the road or stream is afterwards diverted by the act or neglect of the person having the control thereof, the railway administration shall not be compelled to provide other accommodation for the crossing of the road or stream.

(4) The Minister may appoint a time for the commencement of any work to be executed under subsection (1), and if for 14 days next after that time the railway administration fails to commence the work, or having commenced it fails to proceed diligently to execute it in a sufficient manner, the Minister may execute it and recover from the railway administration the cost incurred by him in the execution thereof.

### Power for owner, occupier or local authority to cause additional accommodation works to be made

14\. If an owner or occupier of any land affected by any railway considers the works made under section 13 to be insufficient for the commodious use of the land, or if the Land Transport Authority desires to construct a public road or other work across, under or over the railway, he may at any time require the railway administration to make at his expense such further accommodation works as he thinks necessary and are agreed to by the railway administration or as, in case of difference of opinion, are authorised by the Minister.

[4/99 wef 01/04/1999]

### Fences, screens, gates and bars

15\.—(1) The Minister may require that within a time to be specified in the requisition or within such further time as he appoints in this behalf —

(a) boundary marks or fences shall be provided or renewed by the railway administration for the railway or any part thereof and for roads constructed in connection therewith;

(b) any works in the nature of a screen near to or adjoining the side of any public road constructed before the making of the railway shall be provided or renewed by the railway administration for the purpose of preventing danger to passengers on the road by reason of horses or other animals being frightened by the sight or noise of the rolling-stock moving on the railway;

(c) suitable gates, chains, bars, stiles or handrails shall be erected or renewed by the railway administration at places where the railway crosses a public road on the level;

(d) persons shall be employed by the railway administration to open and shut such gates, chains or bars.

### Penalty

(2) Any railway company which fails to comply with any requisition made under this section shall forfeit to the Government a sum of $100 for every day after the first during which such default continues.

### Over and under bridges

16\.—(1) Where the railway administration has constructed the railway across a public road on the level, the Minister may at any time, if it appears to him necessary for the public safety, require the railway administration within such time as he thinks fit to carry the road either under or over the railway by means of a bridge or arch with convenient ascents and descents and other convenient approaches instead of crossing the road on the level, or to execute such other works as in the circumstances of the case appear to the Minister to be best adapted for removing or diminishing the danger arising from the level crossing.

(2) The Minister may require as a condition of making a requisition under subsection (1) that the Land Transport Authority shall undertake to pay the whole of the cost to the railway administration of complying with the requisition or such portion of the cost as the Minister thinks just.

[4/99 wef 01/04/1999]

### Level crossings over public carriageways

17\.—(1) Where a railway crosses any public carriage road on a level, the railway administration shall erect and at all times maintain good and sufficient gates across the railway on each side of such road where the road communicates with the railway, and shall employ proper persons to open and shut such gates.

(2) Such gates shall be kept constantly closed across such railway except when engines or carriages passing along the railway have occasion to cross such road, and the person entrusted with the care of the gates shall cause the gates to be closed, as soon as the engines or carriages have passed through the gates, under penalty of a sum not exceeding $50 for every default therein.

(3) The Minister may in any case order that any of such gates may be kept closed against the road instead of against the railway.

(4) The Minister may impose any conditions with regard to such order.

### Penalty

(5) Any railway company which fails to erect or maintain sufficient gates in accordance with this section at any level crossing, or fails to employ a proper person to open and shut such gates shall forfeit to the Government a sum of $100 for every day during which such default continues.

(6) (a) The Minister may, subject to such conditions as he thinks fit to impose, declare that subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply to such crossings as are specified in the declaration and thereupon the railway administration shall be relieved of the obligations under those subsections in respect of the crossings. Such declaration shall be published in theGazette.

(b) Where any such declaration has been made the railway administration shall erect warning boards alongside of the public carriage road and whistle-signals upon the railway at suitable distances from such level crossings, and the driver of every locomotive engine shall sound the whistle of his engine in accordance with the signals before the engine crosses the road.
