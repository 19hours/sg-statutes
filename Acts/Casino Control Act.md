the Comptroller may to the best of his judgment assess the amount of casino tax due from that casino operator for that period and notify the casino operator of the amount assessed.

(2) In any case where —

(b) an amount has been paid or credited to any casino operator as being due to it, which ought not to have been paid or credited to it,

(a) under the same provision as that under which the assessment was made; and

(b) within the period during which that assessment could have been made,

make a supplementary assessment of the amount of the excess and shall notify the casino operator accordingly.

(7) Where an amount has been assessed and notified to any casino operator under subsection (1), (2) or (6), it shall, subject to the provisions of this Act as to review and appeals, be deemed to be an amount of casino tax due from the casino operator and may be recovered accordingly, unless, or except to the extent that, the assessment has subsequently been withdrawn or reduced.

(8) The Comptroller may at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment made under this section as he thinks necessary to ensure the correctness thereof and notify the casino operator accordingly.
