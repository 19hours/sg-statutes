### Conventions to have force of law

3\.—(1) Subject to this Act, the provisions of the Convention and the amended Convention shall, so far as they relate to the rights and liabilities of carriers, carriers’ servants and agents, passengers, consignors, consignees and other persons, have the force of law in Singapore in relation to any carriage by air to which the Convention or the amended Convention, as the case may require applies, irrespective of the nationality of the aircraft performing that carriage.

(2) If there is any inconsistency between any of the texts set out in the First and Second Schedules and the authentic text in the French language of the Warsaw Convention or the Hague Protocol, as the case may be, the authentic French text shall prevail.

(3) Subsection (1) shall not apply so as to affect rights or liabilities arising out of an occurrence before the commencement of this Act.

### Certification of High Contracting Parties

4\.—(1) The Minister may by order published in theGazette, from time to time certify who are the High Contracting Parties to the Convention and the High Contracting Parties to the amended Convention, in respect of what territories they are respectively parties and to what extent they have availed themselves of the provisions of the Additional Protocol at the end of the Convention and the amended Convention.

(2) Article 40A(2) in the First Schedule shall not be read as extending references in that Schedule to the territory of a High Contracting Party (except such as are references to the territory of any State, whether a High Contracting Party or not) to include any territory in respect of which that High Contracting Party is not a party.

(3) Without prejudice to subsection (2), a court before which proceedings are brought to enforce a liability which is limited by Article 22 in the First or Second Schedule shall, where the liability is, or may be, partly enforceable in other proceedings in Singapore or elsewhere, have jurisdiction to award an amount less than the court would have awarded if the limitation applied solely to the proceedings before the court, or to make any part of its award conditional on the result of any other proceedings.

(4) The Minister may, by order published in theGazette, from time to time specify the respective amounts which for the purposes of Article 22 in the First and Second Schedules, are to be taken as equivalent to the sums expressed in francs which are mentioned in that Article.

### Time for bringing proceedings

8\.—(1) No action against a carrier’s servant or agent which arises out of damage to which the Convention or the amended Convention relates shall, if he was acting within the scope of his employment, be brought after more than two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped.

(2) Article 29 in the First and Second Schedules shall not be read as applying to any proceedings for contribution between persons liable for any damage to which the Convention or the amended Convention relates.

(3) Subject to sections 4 and 29 of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163), no action shall be brought by a person, liable for any damage to which the Convention or the amended Convention relates, to recover contribution from any other person in respect of such damage after the expiration of two years from the time when a court gives judgment or makes an award against the person seeking to recover the contribution.

(4) Subsections (1), (2) and (3) and Article 29 in the First and Second Schedules shall have effect as if references in those provisions to an action included references to an arbitration; and section 30(3) and (4) of the Limitation Act (which determine the time at which an arbitration is deemed to be commenced), shall apply for the purposes of this subsection.

### Contributory negligence

9\. It is hereby declared that, for the purposes of Article 21 in the First and Second Schedules, the provisions of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap. 54) are provisions of the law of Singapore under which a court may exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability.

Every High Contracting Party to the Convention or the amended Convention who has not availed himself of the provisions of the Additional Protocol at the end of the First or Second Schedule shall, for the purposes of any action brought in a court in Singapore in accordance with Article 28 in the First or Second Schedule to enforce a claim in respect of carriage undertaken by him, be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of that court, and accordingly rules of court may provide for the manner in which any action is to be commenced and carried on; but nothing in this section shall authorise the issue of execution against the property of any High Contracting Party.

### Application to carriage by air not governed by the amended Convention

12\. The Minister may make regulations applying the provisions of the First Schedule and any provision of this Act to such carriage by air, not being international carriage by air as defined in the First Schedule, as may be specified in the regulations, subject to such exceptions, adaptations and modifications, if any, as may be so specified.

Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.

(3) Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State\.

(2) The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents\.

Chapter III

Liability of the Carrier

Article 17

The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.

Article 18

(1) The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or of damage to, any registered baggage or any cargo, if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air\.

(2) The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding paragraph comprises the period during which the baggage or cargo is in charge of the carrier, whether in an aerodrome or on board an aircraft, or, in the case of a landing outside an aerodrome, in any place whatsoever\.

(3) The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an aerodrome\. If, however, such a carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air.

Article 19

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, bagagge or cargo.

Article 20

The carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him and them to take such measures.

Article 21

If the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the injured person the court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability.

Article 22

Where, in accordance with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodical payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments shall not exceed two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability.

(2)(a) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of two hundred and fifty francs per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the passenger’s or consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination.

(b)

In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered baggage or cargo or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.

(3) As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to five thousand francs per passenger\.

(4) The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff\. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.

(5) The sums mentioned in francs in this Article shall be deemed to refer to a currency unit consisting of sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred\. These sums may be converted into national currencies in round figures. Conversion of the sums into national currencies other than gold shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the gold value of such currencies at the date of the judgment.

Article 23

(1) Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention\.

(2) Paragraph (1) of this Article shall not apply to provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried\.

Article 24

(1) In the cases covered by Articles 18 and 19-any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention\.

(2) In the cases covered by Article 17 the provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply, without prejudice to the questions as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights\.

Article 25

[The limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that he was acting within the scope of his employment.]

Article 25A

(1) If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which this Convention relates, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which that carrier himself is entitled to invoke under Article 22\.

(2) The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, his servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits\.

(3) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result\.

Article 26

(2) In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of baggage and fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo\. In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his disposal.

(3) Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage or by separate notice in writing despatched within the times aforesaid\.

(4) Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part\.

Article 27

In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his estate.

Article 28

(1) An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the court having jurisdiction at the place of destination\.

(2) Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the court seised of the case\.

(2) In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey\.

(3) As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place\. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.

Scope — Definitions

Article 1

(1) This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward\. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.

(2) For the purposes of this Convention, the expression “international carriage” means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties, or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, if there is an agreed stopping place within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of another Power, even though that Power is not a party to this Convention\. A carriage without such an agreed stopping place between territories subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of the same High Contracting Party is not deemed to be international for the purposes of this Convention.

(3) Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage, if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of the same High Contracting Party\.

Article 2

(1) The Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1\.

(2) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 250 francs per kilogram, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of the value at delivery and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires\.

Article 26

(1) Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of baggage or cargo without complaint isprima facieevidence that the same has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage\.
