(5) In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.

(6) Notwithstanding any other written law or rule of practice requiring evidence to be corroborated or regulating the manner in which uncorroborated evidence is to be treated, a statement which is admissible in evidence by virtue of this section shall not be capable of corroborating evidence given by the maker of the statement.

### Questions lawful in cross-examination

148\. When a witness may be cross-examined, he may, in addition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend —

(a) to test his accuracy, veracity or credibility;

(b) to discover who he is and what is his position in life; or

(c) to shake his credit by injuring his character, although the answer to such questions might tend directly or indirectly to criminate him, or might expose or tend directly or indirectly to expose him to a penalty or forfeiture.

### When witness to be compelled to answer

149\. If any such question relates to a matter relevant to the suit or proceeding, section 134 shall apply thereto.

### Court to decide when question shall be asked and when witness compelled to answer

150\.—(1) If any question relates to a matter not relevant to the suit or proceeding, except in so far as it affects the credit of the witness by injuring his character, the court shall decide whether or not the witness shall be compelled to answer it, and may, if it does not think fit to compel him to answer the question, warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer it.

(2) In exercising its discretion, the court shall have regard to the following considerations:

(a) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies;

(b) such questions are improper if the imputation which they convey relates to matters so remote in time or of such character that the truth of the imputation would not affect or would affect in a slight degree the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies;

(c) such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the importance of the imputation made against the witness’s character and the importance of his evidence;

(d) the court may, if it sees fit, draw from the witness’s refusal to answer, the inference that the answer, if given, would be unfavourable.

### Question not to be asked without reasonable grounds

151\. No such question as is referred to in section 150 ought to be asked unless the person asking it has reasonable grounds for thinking that the imputation which it conveys is well founded.

Illustrations

(a)

An advocate is instructed by a solicitor that an important witness is a professional gambler. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a professional gambler.

(b)

An advocate is informed by a person in court that an important witness is a professional gambler. The informant, on being questioned by the advocate, gives satisfactory reasons for his statement. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a professional gambler.

(c)

A witness of whom nothing whatever is known, is asked at random whether he is a professional gambler. There are here no reasonable grounds for the question.

(d)

A witness of whom nothing whatever is known being questioned as to his mode of life and means of living gives unsatisfactory answers. This may be a reasonable ground for asking him if he is a professional gambler.

### Procedure of court in case of question being asked without reasonable grounds

152\. If the court is of opinion that any such question was asked without reasonable grounds, it may, if it was asked by any advocate or solicitor, report the circumstances of the case to the Supreme Court in order that the Judges may, if they think fit, exercise the power to suspend or strike off the roll of advocates and solicitors given to them under the Legal Profession Act [Cap. 161, 1990 Ed].

### Indecent and scandalous questions

153\. The court may forbid any questions or inquiries which it regards as indecent or scandalous, although such questions or inquiries may have some bearing on the questions before the court, unless they relate to facts in issue or to matters necessary to be known in order to determine whether or not the facts in issue existed.

### Questions intended to insult or annoy

154\. The court shall forbid any question which appears to it to be intended to insult or annoy, or which though proper in itself, appears to the court needlessly offensive in form.

### Exclusion of evidence of contradict answers to questions testingveracity

155\. When a witness has been asked and has answered any question which isrelevant to the inquiry only in so far as it tends to shake his credit byinjuring his character, no evidence shall be given to contradict him; but ifhe answers falsely he may afterwards be charged with giving falseevidence.

Exception1.—If a witness is asked whether he has been previously convicted of any crimeand denies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction.

Exception2.—If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality andanswers it by denying the facts suggested, he may be contradicted.

Illustrations

(a)

(e)

Ais asked whether hehas not said that he would be revenged onB, against whom hegives evidence. He denies it.

He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach hisimpartiality.

### Questions by party to his own witness

156\. The court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party.

### Impeaching credit of witness

157\. The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by theadverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who callshim:

(a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they from their knowledge ofthe witness believe him to be unworthy of credit;

(b) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of abribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;

(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidencewhich is liable to be contradicted;

(d) when a man is prosecuted for rape or an attempt to ravish, it may be shownthat the prosecutrix was of generally immoral character.

Explanation1.—A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may not, uponhis examination-in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked hisreasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot becontradicted, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged withgiving false evidence.

### Questions tending to corroborate evidence of relevant fact admissible

158\.—(1) When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence of any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred, if the court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as to the relevant fact to which he testifies.

(2) Any rule of law or practice whereby in criminal proceedings the evidence of one witness is incapable of corroborating the evidence of another witness is hereby abrogated.

### Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact

159\. In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.

### What matters may be proved in connection with proved statement relevant under section 32 or 33

160\. Whenever any statement relevant under section 32 or 33 is proved, all matters may be proved either in order to contradict or to corroborate it, or in order to impeach or confirm the credit of the person by whom it was made, which might have been proved if that person had been called as a witness and had denied upon cross-examination the truth of the matter suggested.

### Refreshing memory

161\.—(1) A witness may while under examination refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory.

(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if, when he read it, he knew it to be correct.

### When witness may use copy of document to refresh memory

(3) Whenever the witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he may, with the permission of the court, refer to a copy of such document:

Provided the court is satisfied that there is sufficient reason for the non-production of the original.

(4) An expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatises.

### Testimony to facts stated in document mentioned in section 161

162\. A witness may also testify to facts mentioned in any such document as is mentioned in section 161 although he has no specific recollection of the facts themselves, if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document.

Illustrations

A book-keeper may testify to facts recorded by him in books regularly kept in the course of business if he knows that the books were correctly kept, although he has forgotten the particular transactions entered.

### Right of adverse party as to writing used to refresh memory

163\. Any writing referred to under section 161 or 162 must be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires it; such party may cross-examine the witness thereupon.

### Production of documents

164\.—(1) A witness summoned to produce a document shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to court notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its production or to its admissibility. The validity of any such objection shall be decided on by the court.

(2) The court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document unless it refers to affairs of State, or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissiblity.

### Translation of documents

(3) If for such a purpose it is necessary to cause any document to be translated, the court may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret unless the document is to be given in evidence; and if the translator disobeys such direction, he shall be held to have committed an offence under section 166 of the Penal Code [Cap. 224].

### Giving as evidence document called for and produced on notice

165\. When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to produce, and such document is produced and inspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it requires him to do so and if it is relevant.

### Using as evidence document production of which was refused onnotice

166\. When a party refuses to produce a document which he has had notice toproduce, he cannot afterwards use the document as evidence without the consentof the other party or the order of the court.

Illustrations

At the trialAcalls for the document, andBrefuses to produce it.Agives secondary evidence of its contents.Bseeks to produce the document itself to contradict thesecondary evidence given byA, or in order to show that theagreement is not stamped. He cannot do so.

### Judge’s power to put questions or order production

167\. The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form at any time, or any witness or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question:

Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Act to be relevant and duly proved:

Provided also that this section shall not authorise any Judge to compel any witness to answer any question or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under sections 123 to 133 if the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under section 150 or 151; nor shall he dispense with the primary evidence of any document, except in the cases hereinbefore excepted.

### Power of assessors to put questions

168\. In cases tried with assessors, the assessors may put any questions to the witnesses through or by leave of the Judge, which the Judge himself might put and which he considers proper.

Improper admission and rejection of evidence

### No new trial for improper admission or rejection of evidence

169\. The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case if it appears to the court before which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision.
