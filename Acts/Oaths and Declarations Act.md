## PART II

OATHS

### Power to administer oaths, etc.

3\.—(1) A court or person acting judicially may administer, or may empower an officer to administer, any oath, affirmation or caution.

### Caution in lieu of oath or affirmation

6\. Where a person required by section 4 or any other written law to take an oath ought not, in the opinion of the court or person acting judicially, to take an oath or make an affirmation by reason of immaturity of age, he may, instead of taking an oath or making an affirmation, be cautioned by the court or person acting judicially to state the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

### Form of oath and affirmation

7\. An oath under section 4 shall be taken and administered, and an affirmation under section 5 shall be made and administered, in accordance with the form and manner prescribed by the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) or any other written law.

### Proceedings and evidence not invalidated by omission of oath, etc.

8\. No omission to take an oath, make an affirmation or administer a caution, and no irregularity in the form or manner in which an oath is taken, an affirmation is made or a caution is administered, shall —
