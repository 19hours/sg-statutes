REVISED EDITION 1999

(1st August 1999)

An Act to consolidate certain provisions of the civil law.

[23rd July 1909]

### Interpretation

2\. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —

“court” means the High Court and includes any Judge thereof whether sitting in court or in chambers;

“executor” means the executor or administrator of a deceased person, and includes, as regards any obligation, any person who takes possession of or intermeddles with the property of a deceased person;

“will” includes a codicil.

### Law and equity to be administered concurrently

3\. In every civil cause or matter commenced in the court, law and equity shall be administered by the court in its original jurisdiction and by the Court of Appeal according to the rules following:

Plaintiffs to have equitable relief in claims

(a) if any plaintiff claims to be entitled to any equitable estate or right, or to relief upon any equitable ground against any deed, instrument or contract, or against any right, title or claim whatsoever asserted by any defendant in such cause or matter, or to any relief founded upon a legal right, which before 1st January 1879 could only have been given by the court on its equity side, the court shall give to such plaintiff such and the same relief, as ought to have been given by the court, on its equity side, in a suit or proceeding for the same, or the like purpose, properly instituted before that date;

Defendants the same in defences

(b) if any defendant claims to be entitled to any equitable estate or right, or to relief upon any equitable ground against any deed, instrument or contract, or against any right, title or claim asserted by any plaintiff in such cause or matter, or alleges any ground of equitable defence to any claim of the plaintiff in such cause or matter, the court shall give to every equitable estate, right or ground of relief so claimed, and to every equitable defence so alleged, such and the same effect, by way of defence against the claim of such plaintiff, as the court on its equity side ought to have given, if the same or the like matters had been relied on by way of defence, in any suit or proceeding instituted in the court on its equity side, for the same or the like purpose, before 1st January 1879;

Defendants to have relief against plaintiffs in suit, service and effect of service

(c) the court may also grant to any defendant, in respect of any equitable estate or right, or other matter of equity, and also in respect of any legal estate, right or title claimed or asserted by him, all such relief against any plaintiff, as such defendant shall have properly claimed by his pleading, and as the court might have granted in any suit instituted for that purpose, by the same defendant against the same plaintiff before 1st January 1879 and also all such relief, relating to or connected with the original subject of the cause or matter, and in like manner claimed against any other person, whether already a party to the same cause or matter or not, who has been duly served with notice in writing of such claim, pursuant to the Rules of Court, as might properly have been granted against such person, if he had been made a defendant to a cause, duly instituted by the same defendant for the like purpose; and every person served with any such notice shall thenceforth be deemed a party to such cause or matter, with the same rights, in respect of his defence against such claim, as if he had been duly sued in the ordinary way by such defendant;

Equitable rights appearing incidentally

(d) the court shall recognise and take notice of all equitable estates, titles and rights, and all equitable duties and liabilities, appearing incidentally in the course of any cause or matter, in the same manner in which the court on its equity side would have recognised and taken notice of the same, in any suit or proceeding duly instituted therein before 1st January 1879;

Suits not to be restrained by prohibition or injunction

(e) no cause or proceeding at any time pending in the court in its original jurisdiction or in the Court of Appeal, shall be restrained by prohibition or injunction; but every matter of equity on which an injunction against the prosecution of any such cause or proceeding might have been obtained if the Civil Law Ordinance 1878 (IV/1878) had not been passed, either unconditionally or on any terms or conditions, may be relied on by way of defence thereto;

Court may grant stay of proceedingsin a summary way

(f) nothing in this Act shall disable the court from directing a stay of proceedings in any cause or matter pending before it, if it thinks fit; and any person, whether a party or not to any such cause or matter, who would have been entitled if the Civil Law Ordinance 1878 had not been passed, to apply to the court to restrain the prosecution thereof, or who may be entitled to enforce, by attachment or otherwise, any judgment, decree, rule or order, contrary to which all or any part of the proceedings in such cause or matter may have been taken, may apply to the court, by summons in a summary way, for a stay of proceedings in such cause or matter, either generally, or so far as is necessary for the purpose of justice; and the court shall thereupon make such order as is just;

Subject as above, court to give effect to claims at law, and by custom or statute

(g) subject to the aforesaid provisions for giving effect to equitable rights and other matters of equity in the manner aforesaid, the said court shall recognise and give effect to all legal claims and demands, and all estates, titles, rights, duties, obligations and liabilities by the common law or by any custom, or created by any law having force in Singapore, in the same manner as the same would have been recognised and given effect to if this Act had not been passed;

Court to grant all such remedies as any of the parties are entitled to in respect of every legal and equitable claim to avoid multiplicity

(h) the court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction and the Court of Appeal, in every cause or matter pending before it, shall grant, either absolutely or on such reasonable terms and conditions as to it seems just, all such remedies whatsoever as any of the parties thereto appear to be entitled to, in respect of any and every legal or equitable claim properly brought forward by them respectively in such cause or matter; so that, as far as possible, all matters so in controversy between the said parties respectively may be completely and finally determined, and all multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning any of such matters avoided.

### Administration of insolvent estates, and winding up of companies. Bankruptcy rules to prevail

4\.—(1) In the administration by any court of the assets of any deceased person whose estate proves to be insufficient for the payment in full of his debts and liabilities, and in the winding up of any company under the Companies Act (Cap. 50) whose assets prove to be insufficient for the payment of its debts and liabilities and the costs of winding up, the same rules shall prevail and be observed as to the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors, and as to debts and liabilities provable, and as to the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities respectively, as are in force for the time being under the law of bankruptcy with respect to the estates of persons adjudged bankrupt.

### Creditors may come in under decree, or winding up

(2) All persons who, in any such case, would be entitled to prove for and receive dividends out of the estate of any such deceased person, or out of the assets of any such company, may come in under the decree or order for the administration of such estate, or under the winding up of such company, and make such claims against the same as they may respectively be entitled to by virtue of this Act.

### Estate for life when not to confer right of equitable waste

(5) An estate for life without impeachment of waste shall not confer, or be deemed to have conferred, upon the tenant for life any legal right to commit waste of the description known as equitable waste, unless an intention to confer such right expressly appears by the instrument creating such estate.

(6) There shall not be any merger by operation of law only of any estate the beneficial interest in which would not before 23rd July 1909 have been deemed to be merged or extinguished in equity.

### Stipulations not of essence of contracts to be construed as in equity

(9) Stipulations in contracts, as to time or otherwise, which would not, before 23rd July 1909, have been deemed to be or to have become of the essence of such contracts in a court of equity, shall receive in all cases the same construction and effect as they would have received in equity before that date.

(6) In the event of the insolvency of an estate against which proceedings are maintainable by virtue of this section, any liability in respect of the cause of action in respect of which the proceedings are maintainable shall be deemed to be a debt provable in the administration of the estate, notwithstanding that it is a demand in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by a contract, promise or breach of trust.

[7

### Abolition of right to damages for loss of expectation of life

11\.—(1) In any action for damages for personal injuries, no damages shall be recoverable in respect of any loss of expectation of life caused to the injured person by the injuries, except that if the injured person’s expectation of life has been reduced by the injuries, the court, in assessing damages in respect of pain and suffering caused by the injuries, shall take into account any suffering caused or likely to be caused to him by awareness that his expectation of life has been so reduced.

(2) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that nothing in this section —

(a) renders the husband of a married woman liable in respect of any contract entered into, or debt or obligation incurred, by her after the marriage in respect of which he would not have been liable if this section had not been enacted;

(b) exempts the husband of a married woman from liability in respect of any contract entered into, or debt or obligation (not being a debt or obligation arising out of the commission of a tort) incurred, by her after the marriage in respect of which he would have been liable if this section had not been enacted;

(c) prevents a husband and wife from acquiring, holding and disposing of, any property jointly or as tenants in common, or from rendering themselves or being rendered jointly liable in respect of any tort, contract, debt or obligation, and of suing and being sued either in tort or in contract or otherwise, in the like manner as if they were not married;

[45/98]

(3) A person shall be liable to make contribution by virtue of subsection (1) notwithstanding that he has ceased to be liable in respect of the damage in question since the time when the damage occurred, unless he ceased to be liable by virtue of the expiry of a period of limitation or prescriptions which extinguished the right on which the claim against him in respect of the damage was based.

[45/98]

(4) A person who has made or agreed to make any payment in bona fide settlement or compromise of any claim made against him in respect of any damage (including a payment into court which has been accepted) shall be entitled to recover contribution in accordance with this section without regard to whether or not he himself is or ever was liable in respect of the damage, provided, however, that he would have been liable assuming that the factual basis of the claim against him could be established.

[45/98]

(5) A judgment given in any action brought in Singapore by or on behalf of the person who suffered the damage in question against any person from whom contribution is sought under this section shall be conclusive in the proceedings for contribution in favour of the person from whom the contribution is sought, provided that the judgment in his favour rested on a determination of the merits of the claim against him in respect of the damage.

[45/98]

(6) References in this section to a person’s liability in respect of any damage are references to any such liability which has been or could be established in an action brought against him in Singapore by or on behalf of the person who suffered the damage; but it is immaterial whether any issues arising in any such action was or would be determined (in accordance with the rules of private international law) by reference to the law of a country outside Singapore.

23\.—(1) Where by any deed, will or other instrument a power is given to appoint movable or immovable property amongst several objects in such manner that no one of the objects of the power can be excluded, or some one or more of the objects of the power cannot be excluded by the donee of the power from a share of that property, but without requiring a substantial share of that property to be given to each object of the power or to each object of the power who cannot be excluded, no appointment, which has been or is after 23rd July 1909 made in exercise of any such power or authority, shall be invalid on the ground that an unsubstantial, illusory or nominal share only is thereby appointed, or left unappointed to devolve upon any one or more of the objects of the power or on the ground that any object of that power has been altogether excluded.

(2) Every such appointment shall be valid and effectual notwithstanding that any one or more of the objects does or do not thereunder, or in default thereof, take more than an unsubstantial, illusory or nominal share, and notwithstanding that any one or more of the objects does or do not thereunder, or in default thereof, take a share or shares of the said property.

### Not to affect any deed which declares the amount of the share

(3) Nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect any provision in any deed, will or other instrument creating any such power as aforesaid, which declares the amount of the share or shares from which no object of the power shall be excluded.

### Not to give any other force to any appointment than the same would have had

[35/93]

(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply to an executor who does not prove the will of his testator and, in the case of an executor who on his death leaves surviving him some other executor of his testator who afterwards proves the will of that testator, it shall cease to apply on such probate being granted.

[35/93]

(3) So long as the chain of such representation is unbroken, the last executor in the chain is the executor of every preceding testator.

[35/93]

(4) The chain of such representation is broken by —

(2) The immovable property so charged shall as between the different persons claiming through or under the deceased person be primarily liable to the payment of all mortgage debts with which the same is charged, every part thereof according to its value bearing a proportionate part of the mortgage debts charged on the whole thereof.

(3) In the construction of the will of any person, a general direction that the debts of the testator shall be paid out of his personal estate shall not be deemed to be a declaration of an intention contrary to or other than the rule contained in this section unless such contrary or other intention is further declared by words expressly or by necessary implication referring to all or some of the testator’s debts or debt charged by way of mortgage on any part of his immovable estate.

(4) In this section, “mortgage” shall be deemed to extend to any lien for unpaid purchase-money upon any immovable property purchased by a testator.

(2) If any person erects any building or makes an improvement upon any lands held by him bona fide in the belief that he had an estate in fee simple or other absolute estate, and that person, his executor or assign, or his under-tenant is evicted from such lands by any person having a better title, the person who erected the building or made the improvement, his executor or assign, shall be entitled —

(a) to have the value of the building or improvement so erected or made during such holding and in such belief estimated and paid or secured to him; or

(b) at the option of the person causing the eviction, to purchase the interest of such person in the lands at the value thereof irrespective of the value of the building or improvement.

[19

### Rules to apply to subordinate courts

29\.

[20

### Presumption of survivorship in regard to claim to property

30\. In all cases where 2 or more persons die in circumstances rendering it uncertain which of them survived the other or others, such deaths shall (subject to any order of the court) for all purposes affecting the title to property be presumed to have occurred in order of seniority and accordingly the younger shall be deemed to have survived the elder.

[21

(c) the duration of the minority or respective minorities of any person or persons living or en ventre sa mere at the death of the grantor, settlor or testator;

(e) a term of 21 years from the date of the making of the disposition; or

(f) the duration of the minority or respective minorities of any person or persons in being at the date of the making of the disposition.

(3) In every case where any accumulation is directed otherwise than in accordance with subsection (2), the direction shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), be void, and the income of the property directed to be accumulated shall, so long as the same is directed to be accumulated contrary to this section, go to and be received by the person or persons who would have been entitled thereto if such accumulation had not been directed.

(4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not extend to any provision —

(a) for payment of the debts of any grantor, settlor, testator or other person; or

(b) for raising portions for —

(i) any child, children or remoter issue of any grantor, settlor or testator; or

(ii) any child, children or remoter issue of a person taking any interest under any settlement or other disposition directing the accumulations or to whom any interest is thereby limited,

and accordingly such provisions may be made as if no statutory restrictions on accumulation of income had been imposed.

[45/2004 wef 15/12/2004]

### Fixed perpetuity period of 100 years

32\.—(1) In the rule against perpetuities as is applicable to any settlement or disposition of property, the perpetuity period shall be 100 years or such shorter period as may be specified in the instrument by which the settlement or disposition is made.

(b) it could, at all times during its currency when that person is of full age and capacity, be exercised by him so as immediately to transfer to himself the whole of the interest governed by the power without the consent of any other person or compliance with any other condition, not being a formal condition relating only to the mode of exercise of the power.

(2) For the purpose of determining whether a disposition made under a power of appointment exercisable by will only is void for remoteness, the power shall be treated as a general power where it would have fallen to be so treated if exercisable by deed.

[45/2004 wef 15/12/2004]

### Necessity to wait and see

34\.—(1) Where, apart from the provisions of this section, a disposition would be invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities, the disposition shall be treated, until such time (if any) as it becomes certain that the vesting will occur, if at all, after the end of the perpetuity period, as if the disposition were not invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities, and its becoming so certain shall not affect the validity of anything previously done in relation to the interest disposed of by way of advancement, application of intermediate income, or otherwise.

(2) Where, apart from the provisions of this section, a disposition consisting of the conferring of a general power of appointment would be invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities, the disposition shall be treated, until such time (if any) as it becomes certain that the power will not be exercisable within the perpetuity period, as if the disposition were not invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities.

(3) Where, apart from the provisions of this section, a disposition consisting of the conferring of any power, option, or other right would be invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities, the disposition shall be treated as regards any exercise of the right within the perpetuity period as if it were not so invalid and, subject to the provisions of this section, shall be treated as invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities only if and so far as the right is not fully exercised within that period.

(4) This section shall apply only in relation to dispositions made on or after the date of commencement of the Trustees (Amendment) Act 2004.
