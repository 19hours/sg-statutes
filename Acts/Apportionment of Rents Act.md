[9/75]

(2) The Collector shall determine the rent payable in respect of each subdivision.

(3) The minimum rent in respect of any subdivision shall be $1 and any fraction of 50 cents shall count as 50 cents.

(5) Any person who fails to comply with subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500.

### Apportionment by Collector

4\. Whenever it appears to the Collector that any land held under a State lease or grant has been subdivided and no notification of the subdivision in respect of the land has been given under section 3 the Collector may determine the rent payable in respect of each subdivision and shall thereafter proceed to make an order of apportionment in accordance with the provisions of this Act which shall apply mutatis mutandis as if the determination has been made by the Collector under section 3(2).

[9/75]

### Mode of service of notice where not personal

5\. If the Collector is unable to find any person upon whom service ought to be effected, he may serve the notice upon that person by posting it on the land and at the Land Office, and such posting shall be deemed to be good service.

### Objection to apportionment

6\. If any person upon whom a notice is served objects to the apportionment of rent, he shall send in his objection in writing to the Collector within one month of the service of the notice.

[9/75]

### Apportionment order when made

7\.—(1) On the expiration of one month from the date of the service of the last served of such notices, the Collector may, under his hand and seal, make an order of apportionment of the rent payable to the Government in respect of each subdivision.

[9/75]

(2) If any objections have been received by him under section 6, he shall consider the objections prior to making his order of apportionment.

(3) An order of apportionment shall be final and binding on every lessee or grantee and holder of a subdivision, notwithstanding that notice may not have been served on all the persons entitled to the various subdivisions of the State lease or grant.

(4) The Collector shall cause a copy of his order to be served upon all persons upon whom a notice was served under section 3(4).

(5) Such service may be effected by posting on the land and at the Land Office.

### Effect of order

8\. From the date of the order of apportionment —

(b) the covenant by the lessee or grantee to pay to the Government the rent specified in the State lease or grant shall, in any case where the lessee or grantee has by duly registered deeds assigned or conveyed the entirety of the land comprised in the State lease or grant, be discharged, and shall, in any case where the lessee or grantee retains a part only of the land comprised in the State lease or grant, be so modified as to apply only to the rent apportioned under this Act to that part of the land comprised in the State lease or grant which is retained by the lessee or grantee; and

(c) any covenant by any person entitled to a subdivision to pay to the lessee or grantee a portion of the rent shall be discharged.

[9/75]
