(3) No liability shall lie personally against any member, officer or employee of the LTA or any other person acting under the direction of the LTA for anything done or intended to be done in good faith and with reasonable care in the execution or purported execution of this Act.

(b) of damage to any property from the provision of any point‑to‑point passenger transport service.

(a) a licensee;

(6) The LTA may, at any time when any emergency directive is in force, revoke the emergency directive by giving notice of that revocation in the same manner as the directive was given.

(7) So far as any emergency directive is inconsistent with the Regulations, the emergency directive prevails.

### How emergency directive is given

33\.—(1) An emergency directive is binding on the person or class of persons to whom it is addressed and given.

(4) Once such an emergency directive is made and given under this section, the LTA must also publish the making of the directive in a manner that the LTA thinks will secure adequate publicity for the fact of making and giving of the emergency directive.

(5) However, failure to publish an emergency directive under subsection (4) does not invalidate the directive.

(6) An emergency directive that is given —

(a) in accordance with subsection (2) takes effect when it is served;

(b) in accordance with subsection (3)(

a

) takes effect when it is served on all the persons in the class in question; and

b

) takes effect at the beginning of the day after the date on which subsection (3)(

b

) has been complied with.

### General duty to comply with emergency directives

(2) A person to whom an emergency directive is given and who is required by the directive to do, or to refrain from doing, for a specified period, the things specified in the directive or the things that are of a description specified in the directive, commits an offence if the person intentionally or negligently fails to comply with the directive.

(3) A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (2) shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

### Ride‑hail fare pricing policy orders

23D\.—(1) Subject to subsection (5) and any regulations made under subsection (9), the Council may, by order published in the

Gazette

(called a ride‑hail fare pricing policy order), set the pricing policy for ride‑hail fares for all types of or any type of ride‑hail service.

(2) Different ride‑hail fare pricing policy orders may be made under subsection (1) in relation to different types of ride‑hail services.

(3) A ride‑hail fare pricing policy order for a ride‑hail service may set the price fixing factors for ride‑hail fares in any manner the Council considers appropriate, including —

(a) fixing the components of ride‑hail fares for the ride‑hail service;

(b) fixing the pricing policy or principles that are to be applied in relation to the ride‑hail service provided;

(c) specifying a factor or factors to be applied, and the manner in which such a factor is or factors are to be applied, in setting ride‑hail fares or terms and conditions for the ride‑hail service provided;

(d) fixing the basis on which prices of ride‑hail fares are to be calculated for different bookable vehicles, for different types of journeys by bookable vehicles, for different passengers or for hiring of bookable vehicles in different circumstances;

(e) fixing a price for components of a ride‑hail fare where a ride‑hail common pricing scheme is permitted and there is no ride‑hail common pricing scheme in effect;

(f) fixing a maximum or minimum price or price range, or a maximum rate of increase or decrease or minimum rate of increase or decrease in the price or the maximum and minimum price for ride‑hail fares for the ride‑hail service provided, or other price control formula;

(g) regulating or prohibiting payment surcharges and charges on transactions involving payment of a ride‑hail fare; and

(h) any other terms the Council considers appropriate.

(4) A ride‑hail fare pricing policy order relating to a type of ride‑hail service may —

(a) permit the ride‑hail industry participants, by a ride‑hail common pricing scheme, to vary one or more components of a ride‑hail fare for that ride‑hail service set for that component in the ride‑hail fare pricing policy order; and

(b) require a ride‑hail industry participant of that type of ride‑hail service to provide information to other ride‑hail industry participants, passengers, prospective passengers or others, or generally publish, or cause to be published, information relating to its prices of and pricing policies for ride‑hail fares for ride‑hail services provided by the ride‑hail industry participant.

(5) In making a ride‑hail fare pricing policy order relating to a type of ride‑hail service, the Council may consider the following factors:

(a) the demand and supply of ride‑hail services and street‑hail services;

(b) the standards of quality, reliability and safety of ride‑hail services and street‑hail services, whether those standards are specified by legislation, agreement or otherwise, and any suggested or actual changes to those standards;

(7) Before the date a ride‑hail fare pricing policy order under subsection (1) relating to a type of ride‑hail service comes into effect, the Council must give notice of the making of the order in such manner as will secure adequate publicity for it.

(8) However, failure to comply with subsection (7) in respect of any such order under subsection (1) does not in itself invalidate the order.

(9) The Minister may make regulations prescribing the content, form and procedure that must be followed by the Council in connection with the preparation and making of a ride‑hail fare pricing policy order for the purposes of subsection (1).

### Lodgment of ride-hail fares and ride-hail common pricing schemes

23E\.—(1) Within the prescribed period after a ride‑hail fare pricing policy order is made for any ride‑hail service but before it takes effect for the ride‑hail service, every ride‑hail industry participant providing that ride‑hail service must —

(a) determine the prices of ride‑hail fares for that ride‑hail service if no prices are set by that order; and

(b) lodge with the Council those prices determined unless the nature of the ride‑hail fare makes lodgment impracticable, together with any supporting information the Council may require.

(2) Where a ride‑hail fare pricing policy order for a ride‑hail service permits a ride‑hail common pricing scheme to vary one or more components of the ride‑hail fare in the ride‑hail fare pricing policy order, the prescribed ride‑hail industry participants for that ride‑hail common pricing scheme —

(a) may start collective negotiations among themselves to determine the common prices of those components of ride‑hail fares to be charged, or to vary those common prices, and the period during which those prices will apply; and

(b) must lodge with the Council the ride‑hail common pricing scheme with the common prices determined or varied under that scheme and the effective date of those prices, together with any supporting information the Council may require.

(3) The common prices last lodged with the Council under subsection (2)(

b

) for any component of a ride‑hail fare for ride‑hail services have the effect of varying, from the date specified in the lodgment, any price set by the Council in the ride‑hail fare pricing policy order for that component for those ride‑hail services (even though not agreed to by all the prescribed ride‑hail industry participants providing those ride‑hail services) until the ride‑hail common pricing scheme is terminated.

(4) To have effect, a ride‑hail common pricing scheme for any component of a ride‑hail fare —

(a) must be in writing;

(b) must be agreed to by the ride‑hail industry participants prescribed for that component of the ride‑hail fare;

(c) must be made after following the procedure (if prescribed) in connection with the preparation and making; and

(d) must state a process for dispute resolution.

(5) A ride‑hail industry participant may be party to more than one ride‑hail common pricing scheme.

(6) For the purposes of the Third Schedule to the Competition Act (Cap. 50B), every ride‑hail common pricing scheme permitted by a ride‑hail fare pricing policy order is, when made, to be regarded as an agreement made in order to comply with a legal requirement.
