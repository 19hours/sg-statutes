(a) to negative or restrict any such liability of the user in respect of persons carried in or upon the motor vehicle as is required by section 4 to be covered by a policy of insurance; or

(b) to impose any conditions with respect to the enforcement of any such liability of the user.

and the fact that a person so carried has willingly accepted as his the risk of negligence on the part of the user shall not be treated as negativing any such liability of the user.

Provided that nothing in this section shall be taken to render void any provision in a policy or security requiring the person insured or secured to repay to the insurer or the giver of the security any sums which the latter may have become liable to pay under the policy or security and which have been applied to the satisfaction of the claims of third parties.

[6

### Avoidance of restrictions on scope of policies covering third-party risks

Provided that nothing in this section shall require an insurer to pay any sum in respect of the liability of any person otherwise than in or towards the discharge of that liability and any sum paid by an insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person.

[7

### Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments against persons insured in respect of third-party risks

9\.—(1) If after a certificate of insurance has been issued under section 4(5) to the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment for a sum exceeding $5,000 in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under section 4(1)(b) (being a liability covered by the terms of the policy) is obtained against any person insured by the policy then, notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy, the insurer shall, subject to this section, pay to the Public Trustee as trustee for the persons entitled thereto any sum payable thereunder in respect of the liability including any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any written law relating to interest on judgments.

[Act 26/1994 wef 01/02/1995]

(b) in respect of any judgment so long as execution thereon is stayed pending an appeal; or

(c) in connection with any liability if before the happening of the event which was the cause of the death or bodily injury giving rise to the liability the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein and either —

(i) before the happening of that event the certificate was surrendered to the insurer or the person to whom the certificate was issued made a statutory declaration stating that the certificate had been lost or destroyed;

(ii) after the happening of that event but before the expiration of a period of 14 days from the taking effect of the cancellation of the policy the certificate was surrendered to the insurer or the person to whom the certificate was issued made such a statutory declaration as aforesaid; or

(iii) either before or after the happening of that event but within the period of 14 days the insurer commenced proceedings under this Act in respect of the failure to surrender the certificate.

(4) No sum shall be payable by an insurer under subsections (1), (2) and (3) if in an action commenced before or within 3 months after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment was given he has obtained a declaration that apart from any provision contained in the policy he is entitled to avoid it on the ground that it was obtained by the non-disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular or, if he has avoided the policy on that ground, that he was entitled to do so apart from any provision contained in it:

Provided that an insurer who has obtained such a declaration in an action shall not thereby become entitled to the benefit of this subsection as respects any judgment obtained in proceedings commenced before the commencement of that action unless before or within 7 days after the commencement of that action he has given notice thereof to the person who is the plaintiff in those proceedings specifying the non-disclosure or false representation on which he proposes to rely and any person to whom notice of such an action is so given shall be entitled if he thinks fit to be made a party thereto.

(5) If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this section to pay in respect of a liability of a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which he would apart from this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability, he shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person.

“material” means of such a nature as to influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in determining whether he will take the risk and if so at what premium and on what conditions; and

“liability covered by the terms of the policy” means a liability which is covered by the policy or which would be so covered but for the fact that the insurer is entitled to avoid or cancel or has avoided or cancelled the policy.

(7) In this Act references to a certificate of insurance in any provision relating to the surrender or the loss or destruction of a certificate of insurance shall in relation to policies under which more than one certificate is issued be construed as references to all the certificates and shall where any copy has been issued of any certificate be construed as including a reference to that copy.

(8) Every judgment for a sum exceeding $5,000 in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under section 4(1)(b) shall provide that the sums payable under the judgment shall be paid to the Public Trustee as trustee for the persons entitled to the benefit of the judgment.

[Act 15/1995 wef 15/07/1995]

(3) Any condition in a policy issued for the purposes of this Act purporting directly or indirectly to avoid the policy or to alter the rights of the party thereunder upon the happening to the insured of any of the events specified in subsection (1)(a) or (b) or upon the making of an order under section 148 of the Bankruptcy Act 1994 in respect of his estate shall be of no effect.

[Act 15/1995 wef 15/07/1995]

(4) Upon a transfer under subsection (1) or (2), the insurer shall, subject to section 12, be under the same liability to the third party as he would have been under to the insured but —

it shall be the duty of the bankrupt debtor, personal representative of the deceased debtor or company and, as the case may be, of the Official Assignee, trustee, liquidator, receiver or manager or person in possession of the property, to give, at the request of any person claiming that the bankrupt debtor, deceased debtor or company is under a liability to him, such information as may reasonably be required by him for the purpose of ascertaining whether any rights have been transferred to and vested in him by this Act and for the purpose of enforcing those rights (if any) and any contract of insurance, in so far as it purports whether directly or indirectly to avoid the contract or to alter the rights of the parties thereunder upon the giving of any such information in the events aforesaid or otherwise to prohibit or prevent the giving thereof in the said events, shall be of no effect.

(3) If the information given to any person in pursuance of subsection (2) discloses reasonable ground for supposing that there have or may have been transferred to him under this Act rights against any particular insurer, that insurer shall be subject to the same duty as is imposed by the said subsection on the persons therein mentioned.
