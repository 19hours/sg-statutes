### Interpretation

“periodical publication” includes every publication issued periodically or in parts or numbers at intervals whether regular or irregular;

“place” includes any vehicle, vessel, train or aircraft, whether in a public place or not;

“prohibited publication” means any publication the importation, sale or circulation of which has been prohibited under section 3;

“publication” includes all written pictorial or printed matter and everything, whether of a nature similar to written or printed matter or not, containing any visible representation, or by its form, shape, or in any manner capable of suggesting words or ideas, and every copy and reproduction or substantial reproduction of any publication.

### Power to prohibit importation, sale or circulation of publications

3\.—(1) If the Minister is of opinion that the importation, sale or circulation of any publication or series of publications published or printed outside Singapore or within Singapore by any person would be contrary to the public interest, he may in his discretion, by order published in theGazette, prohibit the importation, sale or circulation of that particular publication or series of publications or all publications published or printed by that person.

(2) If an order made under subsection (1) specifies by name a publication which is a periodical publication, the order shall, unless a contrary intention be expressed therein, have effect with respect to —

(a) all past and subsequent issues of such publication; and

(b) any publication published or printed under any other name if the publishing or printing thereof is in any respect a continuation of, or in substitution for, the publishing or printing of the publication named in the order.

(3) If an order made under subsection (1) prohibits the importation, sale or circulation of all publications published or printed by a specified person that order shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed therein, have effect not only with respect to all publications published or printed by that person before the date of the order but also with respect to all publications so published or printed on or after that date.

(4) An order made under subsection (1) shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed therein, apply to any translation into any language of the publication specified in the order.

(5) The Minister may at any time revoke, vary or amend any order made under this section.

### Offences

4\.—(1) Any person who imports, publishes, sells, offers for sale, distributes or reproduces any prohibited publication or any extract therefrom shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction for a first offence to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both, and for a subsequent offence to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 4 years.

(2) Any person who without reasonable excuse has in his possession any prohibited publication or any extract therefrom shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction for a first offence to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both, and for a subsequent offence to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years.

(3) In any proceedings against any person for an offence under subsection (2) that person shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the contents and the nature of the contents of any publication immediately after such publication came into his possession.

### Delivery of prohibited publication to police station

5\. Any person —

(a) to whom any prohibited publication or any extract therefrom is sent without his knowledge or privity or is sent in response to a request made by that person before the prohibition of the importation, sale or circulation of such publication came into effect; or

(b) who has such a publication or extract therefrom in his possession at the time when the prohibition of its importation, sale or circulation comes into effect,

shall forthwith, as soon as the nature of its contents has become known to him, or in the case of a publication or extract therefrom coming into the possession of that person before an order prohibiting its importation, sale or circulation has been made upon the coming into effect of that order, deliver such publication or extract therefrom to the officer in charge of a police station and in default thereof shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.

### Power to examine packages

6\.—(1) Any —

(a) officer of the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore not below the rank of postal superintendent;

(b) officer of the Customs and Excise Department not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Customs and Excise;

(c) police officer not below the rank of sergeant; and

(d) other officer authorised in that behalf by the Minister,

### Forfeiture

7\. A court before which any proceedings are taken under this Act, if satisfied that any document produced in the proceedings is a prohibited publication or an extract therefrom, shall whether the alleged offender is convicted or not, order such publication or extract therefrom to be forfeited to the Commissioner of Police, who shall order the same to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of in such manner as he thinks fit.

### Issue of search warrant

8\.—(1) Whenever it appears to any Magistrate upon information and after such inquiry as he thinks necessary that there is reasonable cause to believe that in any premises or place there is concealed or deposited any prohibited publication or extract therefrom, such Magistrate may, by warrant directed to any police officer, empower that officer to enter such premises or place by force if necessary to search for, seize and detain any such publication.

[21/73]

(2) Whenever it appears to any police officer, not below the rank of sergeant, that there is reasonable cause to believe that in any premises or place there is concealed or deposited any prohibited publication or extract therefrom, and he has good grounds for believing that by reason of the delay in obtaining a search warrant the object of the search is likely to be frustrated he may enter and search such premises or place as if he were empowered to do so by a warrant issued under subsection (1).

Provided that instead of destroying or causing any such publication to be destroyed the controller or authorised officer may in his discretion permit the same to be sent to a destination outside Singapore; and

(b) shall, if the publication is not in his opinion a publication prejudicial to public safety or public interest in Singapore return the publication to the person from whom it was seized.
