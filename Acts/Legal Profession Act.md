[42/2005 wef 01/01/2006]

(9) If in any such case the client pays the whole or any part of the amount payable under the agreement without the previous allowance of the Registrar or court or Judge as aforesaid, he shall be liable at any time to account to the person whose estate or property is charged with the amount paid, or with any part thereof, for the amount so charged.

(2) Where a law corporation has made an agreement with its client under section 111 and anything has been done by the law corporation or any of its directors or employees under the agreement, and, before the agreement has been completely performed by the law corporation or any of its directors or employees, the law corporation is wound up, an application may be made to the court by any party thereto or by the representatives of that party.

[4/2000]

(2A) Where a limited liability law partnership has made an agreement with its client under section 111 and anything has been done by the limited liability law partnership or any of its partners or employees under the agreement, and, before the agreement has been completely performed by the limited liability law partnership or any of its partners or employees, the limited liability law partnership is wound up, an application may be made to the court by any party thereto or by the representatives of that party.

(3) The court shall thereupon have the same power to enforce or set aside the agreement, so far as it may have been acted upon, as if the death or incapacity had not happened.

(4) The court may, even if it thinks the agreement to be in all respects fair and reasonable, order the amount due in respect of the business done thereunder to be ascertained by taxation.

(5) The Registrar in ascertaining that amount shall have regard, so far as may be, to the terms of the agreement.

(6) Payment of the amount found to be due may be enforced in the same manner as if the agreement had been completely performed by the solicitor.

### Change of solicitor after agreement

115\.—(1) If, after an agreement under section 111 has been made, the client changes his solicitor before the conclusion of the business to which the agreement relates (which he may do notwithstanding the agreement) the solicitor who is a party to the agreement shall be deemed to have become incapable to act under it within the meaning of section 114.

(2) Upon any order being made for taxation of the amount due to that solicitor in respect of business done under the agreement, the court shall direct the Registrar to have regard to the circumstances under which the change of solicitor has taken place.
