(2) No order under this paragraph shall take effect in relation to any person to whom it applies unless the Society has served a copy of the order on him (whether or not he is named in it) and, in the case of a bank, has indicated at which of its branches the Society believes that the money to which the order relates is held.

(3) A person shall not be treated as having disobeyed an order under this paragraph by making a payment of money if he satisfies the High Court that he exercised due diligence to ascertain whether it was money to which the order related but nevertheless failed to ascertain that the order related to it.

(4) This paragraph shall not apply where the powers conferred by this Part are exercisable by virtue of paragraph 3.

10.—(1) Without prejudice to paragraph 9, if the Council passes a resolution to the effect that any sums of money to which this paragraph applies, and the right to recover or receive such sums, shall vest in the Society, all such sums shall vest accordingly (whether they were received by the person holding them before or after the Council’s resolution) and shall be held by the Society on trust to exercise in relation to them the powers conferred by this Part and subject thereto upon trust for the persons beneficially entitled to them.

(2) This paragraph shall apply —

(5) If the High Court makes such an order, it shall have power also to make such other order with respect to the matter as it may think fit.

(6) If any person on whom a notice has been served under sub-paragraph (3) pays out sums of money at a time when the payment is prohibited by the notice, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

11.—(1) If the Society takes possession of any sum of money to which paragraph 10 applies, the Society shall pay it into a special account in the name of the Society or of a person nominated on behalf of the Society, and that person shall hold that sum on trust to permit the Society to exercise in relation to it the powers conferred by this Part and subject thereto on trust for the persons beneficially entitled to it.

(2) A bank at which a special account is kept shall be under no obligation to ascertain whether it is being dealt with properly.

(6) On making an order under this paragraph, or at any later time, the High Court may, on the application of the Society, authorise a person appointed by the Society to enter any premises (using such force as is reasonably necessary) to search for and take possession of any documents to which the order relates.

(7) The Society may, on taking possession of any documents under this paragraph, serve upon the solicitor or his personal representatives and upon any other person from whom they were received on the Society’s behalf or from whose premises they were taken a notice that possession has been taken on the date specified in the notice.
