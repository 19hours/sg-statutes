(2) Every such agreement shall be signed by the client and shall be subject to the provisions and conditions contained in this Part.

[108

### Effect of agreements with respect to contentious business

112\.—(1) Such an agreement as is mentioned in section 111 shall not affect the amount of, or any rights or remedies for the recovery of, any costs recoverable from the client by, or payable to the client by, any other person, and that person may, unless he has otherwise agreed, require any costs payable or recoverable by him to or from the client to be taxed according to the rules for the time being in force for the taxation of those costs:

Provided that the client shall not be entitled to recover from any other person, under any order for the payment of any costs which are the subject of the agreement, more than the amount payable by the client to his own solicitor under the agreement.

(2) Such an agreement shall be deemed to exclude any further claim of the solicitor beyond the terms of agreement in respect of any services, fees, charges or disbursements in relation to the conduct and completion of the business in reference to which the agreement is made, except such services, fees, charges or disbursements (if any) as are expressly excepted by the agreement.

(3) Subject to the provisions of this Part, the costs of a solicitor, in any case where there is such an agreement as is referred to in section 111, shall not be subject to taxation nor to the provisions of section 118.

(4) A provision in any such agreement that the solicitor shall not be liable for negligence, or that he shall be relieved from any responsibility to which he would otherwise be subject as a solicitor, shall be wholly void.

[109

### Enforcement of agreements

113\.—(1) No action or suit shall be brought or instituted upon any such agreement as is referred to in section 111, but every question respecting the validity or effect of the agreement may be examined and determined, and the agreement may be enforced or set aside without suit or action on the summons, motion or petition of any person or the representatives of any person, party to the agreement, or being or alleged to be liable to pay, or being or claiming to be entitled to be paid the costs, fees, charges or disbursements in respect of which the agreement is made, by the court in which the business or any part thereof was done or a judge thereof, or, if the business was not done in any court, then by the High Court or a judge.

(2) Upon any such summons, motion or petition, if it appears to the court or judge that the agreement is in all respects fair and reasonable between the parties, it may be enforced by the court or judge by rule or order, in such manner and subject to such conditions (if any) as to the costs of the summons, motion or petition as the court or judge thinks fit.

(3) If the terms of the agreement are deemed by the court or judge to be unfair or unreasonable, the agreement may be declared void, and the court or judge may thereupon order the agreement to be given up to be cancelled, and may direct the costs, fees, charges and disbursements incurred or chargeable in respect of the matters included therein to be taxed, in the same manner and according to the same rules as if the agreement had not been made.

(4) The court or judge may also make such order as to the costs of and relating to the summons, motion or petition and the proceedings thereon as the court or judge thinks fit.

(5) When the amount agreed for under any such agreement has been paid by or on behalf of the client or by any person chargeable with or entitled to pay it, any court or judge having jurisdiction to examine and enforce the agreement may, on application by the person who has paid the amount within 12 months after payment, if it appears to the court or judge that the special circumstances of the case require the agreement to be reopened, reopen it, and order the costs, fees, charges and disbursements to be taxed, and the whole or any portion of the amount received by the solicitor to be repaid by him, on such terms and conditions as to the court or judge seems just.

(6) Where any such agreement is made by the client in the capacity of guardian or of trustee under a deed or will, or of committee of any person or persons whose estate or property will be chargeable with the amount payable under the agreement or with any part of that amount, the agreement shall before payment be laid before the Registrar, who shall examine it and disallow any part thereof, or may require the direction of the court or a judge to be taken thereon by summons, motion or petition.

(7) If in any such case the client pays the whole or any part of the amount payable under the agreement without the previous allowance of the Registrar or court or judge as aforesaid, he shall be liable at any time to account to the person whose estate or property is charged with the amount paid, or with any part thereof, for the amount so charged, and the solicitor who accepts the payment may be ordered by any court which would have had jurisdiction to enforce the agreement, if it thinks fit, to refund the amount received by him.

[110

### Death or incapability of solicitor after agreement

114\.—(1) Where a solicitor has made an agreement with his client, in pursuance of section 111 and anything has been done by the solicitor under the agreement, and, before the agreement has been completely performed by him, the solicitor dies or becomes incapable to act, an application may be made to the court by any party thereto or by the representatives of that party, and the court shall thereupon have the same power to enforce or set aside the agreement, so far as it may have been acted upon, as if the death or incapacity had not happened.

(2) The court, even if it thinks the agreement to be in all respects fair and reasonable, may order the amount due in respect of the business done thereunder to be ascertained by taxation.

(3) The Registrar in ascertaining that amount shall have regard, so far as may be, to the terms of the agreement.

(4) Payment of the amount found to be due may be enforced in the same manner as if the agreement had been completely performed by the solicitor.

[111

### Change of solicitor after agreement

115\.—(1) If, after an agreement in pursuance of section 111 has been made, the client changes his solicitor before the conclusion of the business to which the agreement relates (which he may do notwithstanding the agreement) the solicitor, party to the agreement, shall be deemed to have become incapable to act under it within the meaning of section 114.

(2) Upon any order being made for taxation of the amount due to that solicitor in respect of business done under the agreement, the court shall direct the Registrar to have regard to the circumstances under which the change of solicitor has taken place.

(3) Upon such taxation the solicitor shall not be deemed to be entitled to the full amount of the remuneration agreed to be paid to him unless it appears that there has been no default, negligence, improper delay or other conduct on his part affording reasonable ground to the client for his change of solicitor.

Part II

POWERS EXERCISABLE ON INTERVENTION

Money

5.—(1) The High Court, on the application of the Society, may order that no payment shall be made without the leave of the Court by any person (whether or not named in the order) of any money held by him (in whatever manner and whether it was received before or after the making of the order) on behalf of the solicitor or his firm.

(2) No order under this paragraph shall take effect in relation to any person to whom it applies unless the Society has served a copy of the order on him (whether or not he is named in it) and, in the case of a bank, has indicated at which of its branches the Society believes that the money to which the order relates is held.

(3) A person shall not be treated as having disobeyed an order under this paragraph by making a payment of money if he satisfies the Court that he exercised due diligence to ascertain whether it was money to which the order related but nevertheless failed to ascertain that the order related to it.

(4) This paragraph shall not apply where the powers conferred by this Part are exercisable by virtue of paragraph 3.

6.—(1) Without prejudice to paragraph 5, if the Council passes a resolution to the effect that any sums of money to which this paragraph applies, and the right to recover or receive them, shall vest in the Society, all such sums shall vest accordingly (whether they were received by the person holding them before or after the Council’s resolution) and shall be held by the Society on trust to exercise in relation to them the powers conferred by this Part and subject thereto upon trust for the persons beneficially entitled to them.

(2) This paragraph applies —

(a) where the powers conferred by this paragraph are exercisable by virtue of paragraph 1, to all sums of money held by or on behalf of the solicitor or his firm in connection with his practice or with any trust of which he is or formerly was a trustee;

(b) where they are exercisable by virtue of paragraph 2, to all sums of money in any client account; and

(c) where they are exercisable by virtue of paragraph 3, to all sums of money held by or on behalf of the solicitor or his firm in connection with the trust or other matter to which the complaint relates.

(3) The Society shall serve on the solicitor or his firm and on any other person having possession of sums of money to which this paragraph applies a certified copy of the Council’s resolution and a notice prohibiting the payment out of any such sums of money.

(4) Within 14 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (3), the person on whom it was served, on giving not less than 48 hours’ notice in writing to the Society and (if the notice gives the name of the solicitor instructed by the Society) to that solicitor, may apply to the High Court for an order directing the Society to withdraw the notice.

(5) If the Court makes such an order, it shall have power also to make such other order with respect to the matter as it may think fit.

(6) If any person on whom a notice has been served under sub-paragraph (3) pays out sums of money at a time when the payment is prohibited by the notice, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

7.—(1) If the Society takes possession of any sum of money to which paragraph 6 applies, the Society shall pay it into a special account in the name of the Society or of a person nominated on behalf of the Society, and that person shall hold that sum on trust to permit the Society to exercise in relation to it the powers conferred by this Part and subject thereto on trust for the persons beneficially entitled to it.

(2) A bank at which a special account is kept shall be under no obligation to ascertain whether it is being dealt with properly.

8\. Without prejudice to paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, if the High Court is satisfied, on an application by the Society, that there is reason to suspect that any person holds money on behalf of the solicitor or his firm, the Court may require that person to give the Society information as to that money and the accounts in which it is held.

Documents

9.—(1) The Society may give notice to the solicitor or his firm requiring the production or delivery to any person appointed by the Society at a time and place to be fixed by the Society —

(a) where the powers conferred by this Part are exercisable by virtue of paragraph 1, of all documents in the possession of the solicitor or his firm in connection with his practice or with any controlled trust; and

(b) where they are exercisable by virtue of paragraph 3, of all documents in the possession of the solicitor or his firm in connection with the trust or other matters to which the complaint relates (whether or not they relate also to other matters).

(2) The person appointed by the Society may take possession of any such documents on behalf of the Society.

(3) Except in a case where an application has been made to the High Court under sub-paragraph (4), if any person having possession of any such documents refuses, neglects or otherwise fails to comply with a requirement under sub-paragraph (1), he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

(4) The High Court may, on the application of the Society, order a person required to produce or deliver documents under sub-paragraph (1) to produce or deliver them to any person appointed by the Society at such time and place as may be specified in the order, and authorise him to take possession of them on behalf of the Society.

(5) If, on an application by the Society, the High Court is satisfied that there is reason to suspect that documents in relation to which the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (1) are exercisable have come into the possession of some person other than the solicitor or his firm, the Court may order that person to produce or deliver the documents to any person appointed by the Society at such time and place as may be specified in the order and authorise him to take possession of them on behalf of the Society.

(6) On making an order under this paragraph, or at any later time, the Court, on the application of the Society, may authorise a person appointed by the Society to enter any premises (using such force as is reasonably necessary) to search for and take possession of any documents to which the order relates.

(7) The Society, on taking possession of any documents under this paragraph, shall serve upon the solicitor or the personal representatives and upon any other person from whom they were received on the Society’s behalf or from whose premises they were taken a notice that possession has been taken on the date specified in the notice.

(8) Subject to sub-paragraph (9) a person upon whom a notice under sub-paragraph (7) is served, on giving not less than 48 hours’ notice to the Society and (if the notice gives the name of the solicitor instructed by the Society) to that solicitor, may apply to the High Court for an order directing the Society to deliver the documents to such person as the applicant may require.

(9) A notice under sub-paragraph (8) shall be given within 8 days of the service of the Society’s notice under sub-paragraph (7).

(10) Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions, the Society may apply to the High Court for an order as to the disposal or destruction of any documents in its possession by virtue of this paragraph.

(11) On an application under sub-paragraph (8) or (10), the Court may make such order as it thinks fit.

(12) Except so far as its right to do so may be restricted by an order on an application under sub-paragraph (8) or (10), the Society may take copies of or extracts from any documents in its possession by virtue of this paragraph and require any person to whom it is proposed that those documents shall be delivered, as a condition precedent to delivery, to give a reasonable undertaking to supply copies or extracts to the Society.

Trusts

10.—(1) If the solicitor or his personal representative is a trustee of a controlled trust, the Society may apply to the High Court for an order for the appointment of a new trustee in substitution for him.

(2) The Trustees Act [Cap. 337] shall have effect in relation to an appointment of a new trustee under this paragraph as it has effect in relation to an appointment under section 40 of that Act.

General

11\. The powers in relation to sums of money and documents conferred by this Part shall be exercisable notwithstanding any lien on them or right to their possession.

12\. Subject to any order for the payment of costs that may be made on an application to the Court under this Schedule, any costs incurred by the Society for the purposes of this Schedule, including, without prejudice to the generality of this paragraph, the costs of any person exercising powers under this Part on behalf of the Society shall be paid by the solicitor or his personal representatives and shall be recoverable from him or them as a debt owing to the Society.

13\. Where an offence under this Schedule committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.

14\. Any application to the High Court under this Schedule may be disposed of in chambers.

15\. The Society may do all things which are reasonably necessary for the purpose of facilitating the exercise of its powers under this Schedule.
