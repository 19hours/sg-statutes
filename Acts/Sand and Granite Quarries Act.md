### Security for due performance of obligations of licensees

6\. The Licensing Officer may, as a condition of the grant of a licence in respect of any sand or granite quarry, require such security as he thinks fit to be deposited with the Licensing Officer for the due performance by the licensee of all or any obligations imposed upon him by the licence or by this Act or any regulations made thereunder.

### Power to execute works

7\.—(1) If a licensee fails to execute any work or works which he is required by his licence or by this Act or any regulations made thereunder to execute for the purpose of preventing any nuisance or danger to life or property, the Licensing Officer may, by notice in writing, require him to execute the work or works within such time as may be specified in the notice.

(2) If the licensee fails to comply with the requirements of such notice, the Licensing Officer may, at any time after the expiration of the time specified in the notice and without instituting any proceedings against the licensee, cause the work or works to be executed and the expenses incurred thereby shall be paid by the licensee and may be recovered by the Licensing Officer —

(a) by deducting the amount due from any sum deposited by the licensee as security under section 6; or

(b) in the manner provided in section 22.

(b) to cause depreciation in the value or amenity of adjoining or neighbouring land or buildings; or

(c) to be dangerous to health, life or property.

### Interference with bank of any river, stream or watercourse

9\.—(1) Any licensee who in the course of sand and granite quarrying operations interferes in any way with the bank of any river, stream or watercourse may be required by the Licensing Officer, by notice in writing, to restore the bank to the same condition as it was in before the interference or to remake it in such manner and within such time as may be specified in the notice.

(2) Any licensee who fails to comply with the requirements of such a notice shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a fine not exceeding $50 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.

(3) The Licensing Officer may, at any time after the expiration of the time specified in such notice and without instituting any proceedings against the licensee, cause the works specified in the notice to be executed and the expenses thereby incurred shall be paid by the licensee in default and may be recovered by the Licensing Officer —

(b) in the manner provided in section 22.

### Effluent water to be free from mud

10\.—(1) Every licensee shall only use fresh water in connection with his sand quarrying operations and shall make such provision or take such steps as will ensure that all the water, before it leaves the sand quarrying area on which it has been so used, is freed from any mud, sand, silt or any other refuse of the sand quarry which is likely to interfere with the natural flow of water in any river, stream, channel or watercourse.

(2) The Licensing Officer may, by notice in writing, require any licensee to provide such spillways, retaining walls, brush dams, settling pits and other mechanical appliances or devices as the Licensing Officer may consider necessary for effectual compliance with subsection (1) and may also order the licensee to suspend his sand quarrying operations until such provision has been made.

(2) The Licensing Officer may, by notice in writing, require any licensee to take such precautions and to construct and maintain such drains, spillways, channels and other works as may in his opinion be necessary to ensure that earth, sludge, dirt, sand, silt or other waste matter from any sand or granite quarry will not be carried or washed away by storm water or by fresh water used for the purpose of working the sand or granite quarry to any place not being a place where the same may lawfully be deposited.

### Excavation by direct action of water

(b) in the case of a granite quarry —

(i) provide such number of guards, watchmen, warning lamps and red flags at such places and times as the Licensing Officer thinks fit;

(ii) not permit any deposit, material, machinery or any other object or thing to be scattered, dumped, placed or stationed at any place so as to hinder or obstruct access to and egress from the land adjoining or abutting any such quarry; and

(iii) maintain the roads leading to any such quarry and crusher plant up to a standard approved by the Licensing Officer.

(2) The Licensing Officer may give a licensee such directions as he thinks fit as to the method of quarrying and the suspension or prohibition of granite quarrying operations including blasting to ensure safety to persons or property.

### Fencing of sand and granite quarries

14\. Where any disused sand or granite quarry is dangerous to the public, it shall be kept reasonably fenced for the prevention of accidents, and if it is not so kept, the licensee of the sand or granite quarry or if there is no such licensee the owner of the land in which the sand or granite quarry lies shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and in the case of a continuing offence to a fine not exceeding $50 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.

### Penalty for obstructing officer in his duty

16\. Any person who at any time hinders, obstructs or molests the Licensing Officer or any officer or employee authorised by the Licensing Officer in writing in that behalf in the performance and execution of his duty or of anything which he is empowered or required to do by virtue or in consequence of this Act, or removes any mark set up for the purpose of indicating any level or direction necessary to the execution of works authorised by this Act, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.

### Default in compliance with notice, etc.

17\.—(1) When any notice, order or direction under this Act or any regulations made thereunder requires any act to be done or work to be executed by the owner or licensee of any sand or granite quarry and default is made in complying with the requirement of that notice, order or direction, as the case may be, the person in default shall, where no fine is specially provided for such default, be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000.

(2) When any such notice requires any act to be done or work to be executed for which no time is fixed by this Act or any regulations made thereunder, the notice shall state a reasonable time for compliance with the requirement.

### Penalty for offences not otherwise provided for

18\. Every omission or neglect to comply with and every act done or attempted to be done contrary to the provisions of this Act or any breach of the conditions or restrictions subject to which or upon which any licence is granted under this Act shall be an offence under this Act and in respect of any such offence for which no penalty is expressly provided the offender shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and in the case of a continuing offence to a fine not exceeding $50 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.
