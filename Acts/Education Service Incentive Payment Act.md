(2) The regulations made under subsection (1) shall provide the payment of an award to a member of the CONNECT Plan or, if the member dies before such payment, to such of his dependants as the Minister thinks fit or, if there are no dependants, to his legal personal representative, on account of the member completing the prescribed period of qualifying service.

### Contributions excluded from bankrupt member’s property

(2) No contribution and interest mentioned in subsection (1) shall pass to the Official Assignee on the bankruptcy of a member, and if the member is adjudicated a bankrupt, such contribution and interest (if any) shall be deemed excluded from the property of the bankrupt for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20).

### Effect on conviction, dismissal, etc., on awards and contributions

8\.—(1) It shall be lawful for the Minister to withhold or refuse to pay (in whole or in part) any award which would under this Act or the regulations made under section 3 be paid to a member if, at the date of the payment of the award, the member —

### Recovery of awards paid in ignorance of disqualifying facts

10\. It shall be a condition of the payment of every award under the CONNECT Plan that the Government may recover, cancel or reduce it if it be shown to have been obtained by the wilful suppression of material facts or to have been paid in ignorance of facts which, had they been known before the payment of that award to the member, would have justified his dismissal from the teaching service or a reduction of his salary.
