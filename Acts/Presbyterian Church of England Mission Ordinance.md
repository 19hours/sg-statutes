And Whereas by two assignments each dated September 1842, and made between the said Hilary Courvezy of the one part, and Benjamin Peach Keasberry for and on behalf of the London Missionary Society of the other part, the said pieces of land were assigned by the said Hilary Courvezy unto the said Benjamin Peach Keasberry as aforesaid, and his successors in the office of missionary in the Malay Department of the Singapore Mission, belonging to the said London Missionary Society for the residue of the said terms:

And Whereas the London Missionary Society permitted the said Committee to use the church erected upon the said pieces of land for the purpose of Divine worship, and ultimately an arrangement was come to whereby the London Missionary Society agreed in consideration of certain payments to be made by the said Committee, which payments have been duly made, to transfer all their rights to the said church and in the said pieces of land to the said Committee:

And Whereas the said leases Nos. 1,646 and 1,918 and the said Statutory Land Grants Nos. 2,675 and 3,772, were all intended to be made for the benefit of the said Committee:
