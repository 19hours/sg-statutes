(a) the person, with the permission of the Registrar, attends and performs that act, or witnesses or attests the doing of that thing, through the use of a live video or live television link that is created using a remote communication technology approved by the Registrar;

(b) the person complies with such conditions that the Registrar considers necessary or expedient to impose relating to the use of the remote communication technology;
