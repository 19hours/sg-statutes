12\.—(1) Attendance at and participation in a mediation session is voluntary.

(2) A party to a mediation session may withdraw from the mediation session at any time.

refer the complaint to a mediator of a Community Mediation Centre for mediation with or without the consent of both the complainant and the person complained against.

[6/2004 wef 03/05/2004]

[15/2010 wef 02/01/2011]
