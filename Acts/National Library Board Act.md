(7) The Board may reprimand, reduce in rank, retire, dismiss or punish in some other manner a person transferred to the service of the Board under subsection (1) for any misconduct or neglect of duty committed before the transfer date which would have rendered him liable to be reprimanded, reduced in rank, retired, dismissed or punished in some other manner if he had continued to be in the employment of the National Heritage Board and if this Act had not been enacted.
