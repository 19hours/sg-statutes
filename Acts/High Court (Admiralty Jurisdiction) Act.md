[34/73]

### Mode of exercise of admiralty jurisdiction

4\.—(1) Subject to section 5, the admiralty jurisdiction of the Court may in all cases be invoked by an action in personam.

(2) The admiralty jurisdiction of the Court may in the cases mentioned in section 3(1)(a) to (c) and (r) be invoked by an action in rem against the ship or property in question.

(3) In any case in which there is a maritime lien or other charge on any ship, aircraft or other property for the amount claimed, the admiralty jurisdiction of the Court may be invoked by an action in rem against that ship, aircraft or property.

(4) In the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section 3(1)(d) to (q), being a claim arising in connection with a ship, where the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam was, when the cause of the action arose, the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control of, the ship, the admiralty jurisdiction of the Court may (whether the claim gives rise to a maritime lien on the ship or not) be invoked by an action in rem against —

(a) that ship, if at the time when the action is brought it is beneficially owned as respects all the shares therein by that person; or

(b) any other ship which, at the time when the action is brought, is beneficially owned as aforesaid.

(5) In the case of a claim in the nature of towage or pilotage in respect of an aircraft, the admiralty jurisdiction of the Court may be invoked by an action in rem against that aircraft if at the time when the action is brought it is beneficially owned by the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam.

(6) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) to (5), the admiralty jurisdiction of the Court shall not be invoked by an action in rem in the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section 3(1)(n) unless the claim relates wholly or partly to wages (including any sum allotted out of wages or adjudged by a superintendent to be due by way of wages.)

(7) Where, in the exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction, the Court orders any ship, aircraft or other property to be sold, the Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any question arising as to the title to the proceeds of sale.

(8) In determining for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) whether a person would be liable on a claim in an action in personam, it shall be assumed that he has his habitual residence or a place of business within Singapore.

### Jurisdiction in personam of Court in collision and other similar cases

5\.—(1) The Court shall not entertain an action in personam to enforce a claim to which this section applies unless —

(a) the defendant has his habitual residence or a place of business within Singapore;

(b) the cause of action arose within inland waters of Singapore or within the limits of the port of Singapore; or

(c) an action arising out of the same incident or series of incidents is proceeding in the Court or has been heard and determined in the Court.

(2) The Court shall not entertain an action in personam to enforce a claim to which this section applies until any proceedings previously brought by the plaintiff in any court outside Singapore against the same defendant in respect of the same incident or series of incidents have been discontinued or otherwise come to an end.

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) shall apply to counter-claims (not being counter-claims in proceedings arising out of the same incident or series of incidents) as they apply to actions in personam, but as if the references to the plaintiff and the defendant were respectively references to the plaintiff on the counter-claim and the defendant to the counter-claim.

(4) Subsections (1) to (3) shall not apply to any action or counter-claim if the defendant thereto submits or has agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court.

(5) Subject to subsection (2), the Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain an action in personam to enforce a claim to which this section applies whenever any of the conditions specified in subsection (1)(a) to (c) are satisfied, and the Rules of Court relating to the service of process outside the jurisdiction shall make such provision as may appear to the rule-making authority to be appropriate having regard to this subsection.

(6) The claims to which this section applies are claims for damage, loss of life or personal injury arising out of a collision between ships or out of the carrying out of or omission to carry out a manoeuvre in the case of one or more of two or more ships or out of non-compliance, on the part of one or more of two or more ships, with the collision regulations.

(7) In this section —

“collision regulations” means the regulations made under section 100(2)(h) of the Merchant Shipping Act (Chapter 179) and any regulations made under subsection (1) of section 41 of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act (Chapter 170A) for or in respect of any of the matters mentioned in paragraph (d) of that subsection;

[Act 7/96 wef 02/02/1996]

### Wages

6\. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting the jurisdiction of the Court to refuse to entertain an action for wages by the master or a member of the crew of a ship, not being a Singapore ship.

7\. The Court shall not have jurisdiction to determine any claim or question certified by the Minister to be a claim or question which, under the Rhine Navigation Convention of 7th October 1868 as revised by any subsequent Convention, falls to be determined in accordance with the provisions thereof and any proceedings to enforce such a claim which are commenced in the Court shall be set aside.
