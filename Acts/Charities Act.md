[34/2010 wef 01/03/2011]

(4) If there is an appeal to the High Court against any decision of the Commissioner to enter an institution in the register, or not to remove an institution from the register, then until the Commissioner is satisfied whether his decision is or is not to stand, the entry in the register shall be maintained, but shall be in suspense and marked to indicate that it is in suspense; and for the purposes of subsection (1) an institution shall be deemed not to be on the register during any period when the entry relating to it is in suspense under this subsection.

(5) Any question affecting the registration or removal from the register of an institution may, notwithstanding that it has been determined by a decision on appeal under subsection (3), be considered afresh by the Commissioner and shall not be concluded by that decision, if it appears to the Commissioner that there has been a change of circumstances or that the decision is inconsistent with a later judicial decision, whether given on such an appeal or not.

(2) Subsection (1) shall apply to a charity if —

(a) it is a registered charity and its name (referred to in this Act as the registered name) is the same as, or is in the opinion of the Commissioner too like, the name, at the time when the registered name was entered in the register in respect of the charity, of any other charity (whether registered or not);

(b) the name of the charity is in the opinion of the Commissioner likely to mislead the public as to the true nature of —

(i) the purposes of the charity as set out in its governing instruments; or

(ii) the activities which the charity carries on under its governing instruments in pursuit of those purposes;

[34/2010 wef 01/03/2011]

(c) the name of the charity includes any word or expression which in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to mislead the public in any respect as to the status of the charity;

(d) the name of the charity is in the opinion of the Commissioner likely to give the impression that the charity is connected in some way with the Government or any public authority, or with any other body of persons or any individual, when it is not so connected; or

(e) the name of the charity is in the opinion of the Commissioner offensive,

and any reference in this subsection to the name of a charity is, in relation to a registered charity, a reference to the name by which it is registered.

(3) Any direction given by virtue of subsection (2)(a) shall be given within 12 months of the time when the registered name was entered in the register in respect of the charity.

(4) Any direction given under this section with respect to a charity shall be given to the governing board members; and on receiving any such direction the governing board members shall give effect to it notwithstanding anything in the governing instruments of the charity.

[34/2010 wef 01/03/2011]

(5) Where the name of any charity is changed under this section, it shall be the duty of the governing board members to notify the Commissioner, within 7 days after such change or such longer period as the Commissioner may, in his discretion, allow, of the new name of the charity and of the date on which the change occurred.

[34/2010 wef 01/03/2011]

[26/2001]

(6) A change of name by a charity under this section shall not affect any rights or obligations of the charity; and any legal proceedings that might have been continued or commenced by or against it in its former name may be continued or commenced by or against it in its new name.

(7) Any reference in this section to the governing board members of a charity shall, in relation to a charity which is a company, be read as a reference to the directors of the company.

[34/2010 wef 01/03/2011]

(8) Where any direction is given under this section with respect to a charity which is a company, the direction shall be taken to require the directors of the company to take the necessary steps to effect the change of the name of the company, including applying to the Registrar of Companies for the reservation and approval of the new name under section 27 or 378 of the Companies Act (Cap. 50), as the case may be.

(9) Nothing in this section shall apply to an exempt charity.

[UK Charities Act 1993, s. 6]

[Act 2 of 2018 wef 01/04/2018]

(4) For the purposes of any such inquiry, evidence may be taken on oath, and the person conducting the inquiry may for that purpose administer oaths, or may instead of administering an oath require the person examined to make and subscribe a declaration of the truth of the matters about which he is examined.

(5) Where the Commissioner proposes to take any action in consequence of an inquiry under this section, the Commissioner may publish the report of the person conducting the inquiry, or such other statement of the results of the inquiry as he thinks fit, in any manner calculated in his opinion to bring it to the attention of persons who may wish to make representations to him about the action to be taken.

(6) A copy of the report of the person conducting an inquiry under this section shall, if certified by the Commissioner to be a true copy, be admissible as evidence of any fact stated in the report, and as evidence of the opinion of that person as to any matter referred to in the report, in any legal proceedings instituted by the Commissioner under section 25 and in any legal proceedings instituted by the Attorney-General in respect of a charity.

(7) A document purporting to be a certificate issued for the purposes of subsection (6) shall be received in evidence and be deemed to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.

(8) If any person wilfully alters, suppresses, conceals or destroys any document which he may be required to produce under this section, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.

## PART VI

APPLICATION OF PROPERTY CY-PRÈS




AND ASSISTANCE AND SUPERVISION OF




CHARITIES BY COURT AND COMMISSIONER

### Occasions for applying property cy-près

21\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), the circumstances in which the original purposes of a charitable gift can be altered to allow the property given or part of it to be applied cy-près shall be as follows:

(a) where the original purposes, in whole or in part —

(i) have been as far as may be fulfilled;

(ii) cannot be carried out; or

(iii) cannot be carried out according to the directions given and to the spirit of the gift;

(b) where the original purposes provide a use for part only of the property available by virtue of the gift;

(c) where the property available by virtue of the gift and other property applicable for similar purposes can be more effectively used in conjunction and to that end can suitably, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, be made applicable to common purposes;

(d) where the original purposes were laid down by reference to an area which then was but has since ceased to be a unit for some other purpose, or by reference to a class of persons or to an area which has for any reason since ceased to be suitable, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, or to be practical in administering the gift; or

(e) where the original purposes, in whole or in part, have, since they were laid down —

(i) been adequately provided for by other means;

(ii) ceased, as being useless or harmful to the community or for other reasons, to be in law charitable; or

(iii) ceased in any other way to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property available by virtue of the gift, regard being had to the spirit of the gift.

(2) Subsection (1) shall not affect the conditions which must be satisfied in order that property given for charitable purposes may be applied cy-près, except in so far as those conditions require a failure of the original purposes.

(3) References in subsections (1) and (2) to the original purposes of a gift shall be construed, where the application of the property given has been altered or regulated by a scheme or otherwise, as referring to the purposes for which the property is for the time being applicable.

(4) It is hereby declared that a trust for charitable purposes places a trustee under a duty, where the case permits and requires the property or some part of it to be applied cy-près, to secure its effective use for charity by taking steps to enable it to be so applied.

(5) This section shall apply to property given for charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was so given before 1st January 1995.

[Charities Act 1985 Ed., s. 11]

### Application cy-près of gifts of donors unknown or disclaiming

22\.—(1) Property given for specific charitable purposes which fail shall be applicable cy-près as if given for charitable purposes generally, where it belongs to a donor who —

(a) after the prescribed advertisements and inquiries have been published and made, and after the prescribed period beginning with the publication of those advertisements has expired, cannot be identified or cannot be found; or

(b) has executed a disclaimer in the prescribed form of his right to have the property returned.

(2) Where the prescribed advertisements and inquiries have been published and made by or on behalf of trustees with respect to any such property, the trustees shall not be liable to pay to any person in respect of the property if no claim by him to be interested in the property is received by the trustees before the expiry of the period specified in subsection (1)(a).

(3) For the purposes of this section, property shall be conclusively presumed (without any advertisement or inquiry) to belong to donors who cannot be identified, in so far as it consists of the proceeds of —

(a) cash collections made by means of collecting boxes or by other means not adapted for distinguishing one gift from another; or

(b) any lottery, competition, entertainment, sale or similar money-raising activity, after allowing for property given to provide prizes or articles for sale or otherwise to enable the activity to be undertaken.

(4) The High Court may by order direct that property not falling within subsection (3) shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated (without any advertisement or inquiry) as belonging to donors who cannot be identified, where it appears to the Court —

(a) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the amounts likely to be returned to the donors, to incur expense with a view to returning the property; or

(b) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the nature, circumstances and amount of the gifts, and to the lapse of time since the gifts were made, for the donors to expect the property to be returned.

(5) Where property is applied cy-près by virtue of this section, the donor shall be deemed to have parted with all his interest at the time when the gift was made; but where property is so applied as belonging to donors who cannot be identified or cannot be found, and is not so applied by virtue of subsection (3) or (4) —

(a) the scheme shall specify the total amount of that property;

(b) the donor of any part of that amount shall be entitled, if he makes a claim not later than 6 months after the date on which the scheme is made, to recover from the charity for which the property is applied a sum equal to that part, less any expenses properly incurred by the governing board members of the charity after that date in connection with claims relating to his gift; and

[34/2010 wef 01/03/2011]

(c) the scheme may include directions as to the provision to be made for meeting any such claim.

(6) Where —

(a) any sum is, in accordance with any directions in a scheme, set aside for meeting any such claims; but

(b) the aggregate amount of any such claims actually made exceeds the relevant amount,

then if the Commissioner so directs, each of the donors in question shall be entitled only to such proportion of the relevant amount as the amount of his claim bears to the aggregate amount referred to in paragraph (b); and for this purpose, “relevant amount” means the amount of the sum so set aside after deduction of any expenses properly incurred by the governing board members of the charity in connection with claims relating to the donors’ gifts.

[34/2010 wef 01/03/2011]

(7) For the purposes of this section, charitable purposes shall be deemed to fail where any difficulty in applying property to those purposes makes that property or the part not applicable cy-près available to be returned to the donors.

(8) In this section, except in so far as the context otherwise requires, references to a donor include persons claiming through or under the original donor, and references to property given include the property for the time being representing the property originally given or property derived from it.

(9) This section shall apply to property given for charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was so given before 1st January 1995.

[Charities Act 1985 Ed., s. 12]

### Entrusting charity property to Public Trustee and termination of trust

23\.—(1) The High Court may by order vest any property held by or in trust for a charity in the Public Trustee or authorise or require the persons in whom the property is vested to transfer it to him, or appoint any person to transfer the property to him; and the property may be vested in the Public Trustee with or without powers of management as the Court may direct.

(2) Where any property is held by or in trust for a charity, or is comprised in any testamentary gift to a charity, the property may, with the agreement of the Public Trustee, be transferred to him; and his receipt for the property comprised in a testamentary gift to a charity shall be a complete discharge of the personal representative.

(3) Where property is vested in the Public Trustee in trust for a charity, the High Court may make an order discharging him from the trusteeship as respects all or any of that property.

(4) Where the Public Trustee is discharged from his trusteeship of any property, or the trusts on which he holds any property come to an end, the High Court may make such vesting orders and give such directions as may seem to the Court to be necessary or expedient in consequence.
