(3) Any institution which no longer appears to the Commissioner to be a charity shall be removed from the register with effect, where the removal is due to any change in its purposes or trusts, from the date of that change; and there shall also be removed from the register any charity which ceases to exist or does not operate.

[10/2007 wef 01/03/2007]

(6) It shall be the duty of —

(a) the charity trustees of any charity which is not registered nor excepted from registration to apply for it to be registered, and to supply the documents and information required by subsection (5), within 3 months after its establishment or such longer period as the Commissioner may, in his discretion, allow; and

and any person who makes default in carrying out any of the duties imposed by this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $50 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction, and the Commissioner may by order require that person to make good that default.

(3) An appeal against any decision of the Commissioner to enter or not to enter an institution in the register of charities, or to remove or not to remove an institution from the register, may be brought in the High Court by the persons who are or claim to be the charity trustees of the institution, or by any person whose objection or application under subsection (2) has been disallowed by the Commissioner; and a copy of every notice of such appeal shall be transmitted to the Attorney-General.

(4) If there is an appeal to the High Court against any decision of the Commissioner to enter an institution in the register, or not to remove an institution from the register, then until the Commissioner is satisfied whether his decision is or is not to stand, the entry in the register shall be maintained, but shall be in suspense and marked to indicate that it is in suspense; and for the purposes of subsection (1) an institution shall be deemed not to be on the register during any period when the entry relating to it is in suspense under this subsection.

(b) the name of the charity is in the opinion of the Commissioner likely to mislead the public as to the true nature of —

(i) the purposes of the charity as set out in its trusts; or

(c) the name of the charity includes any word or expression which in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to mislead the public in any respect as to the status of the charity;

(e) the name of the charity is in the opinion of the Commissioner offensive,

and any reference in this subsection to the name of a charity is, in relation to a registered charity, a reference to the name by which it is registered.

(3) Any direction given by virtue of subsection (2)(a) shall be given within 12 months of the time when the registered name was entered in the register in respect of the charity.

(4) Any direction given under this section with respect to a charity shall be given to the charity trustees; and on receiving any such direction the charity trustees shall give effect to it notwithstanding anything in the trusts of the charity.

(5) Where the name of any charity is changed under this section, it shall be the duty of the charity trustees to notify the Commissioner, within 7 days after such change or such longer period as the Commissioner may, in his discretion, allow, of the new name of the charity and of the date on which the change occurred.

[26/2001 wef 01/03/2002]

(6) A change of name by a charity under this section shall not affect any rights or obligations of the charity; and any legal proceedings that might have been continued or commenced by or against it in its former name may be continued or commenced by or against it in its new name.

(7) Any reference in this section to the charity trustees of a charity shall, in relation to a charity which is a company, be read as a reference to the directors of the company.

(8) Where any direction is given under this section with respect to a charity which is a company, the direction shall be taken to require the directors of the company to take the necessary steps to effect the change of the name of the company, including applying to the Registrar of Companies for the reservation and approval of the new name under section 27 or 378 of the Companies Act [Cap. 50], as the case may be.

(9) Nothing in this section shall apply to an exempt charity.

### General power of Commissioner to institute inquiries

(b) to furnish copies of documents in his custody or under his control which relate to any matter in question at the inquiry, and to verify any such copies by statutory declaration; and

(4) For the purposes of any such inquiry, evidence may be taken on oath, and the person conducting the inquiry may for that purpose administer oaths, or may instead of administering an oath require the person examined to make and subscribe a declaration of the truth of the matters about which he is examined.

(5) Where the Commissioner proposes to take any action in consequence of an inquiry under this section, the Commissioner may publish the report of the person conducting the inquiry, or such other statement of the results of the inquiry as he thinks fit, in any manner calculated in his opinion to bring it to the attention of persons who may wish to make representations to him about the action to be taken.

(6) A copy of the report of the person conducting an inquiry under this section shall, if certified by the Commissioner to be a true copy, be admissible as evidence of any fact stated in the report, and as evidence of the opinion of that person as to any matter referred to in the report, in any legal proceedings instituted by the Commissioner under section 25 and in any legal proceedings instituted by the Attorney-General in respect of a charity.

(7) A document purporting to be a certificate issued for the purposes of subsection (6) shall be received in evidence and be deemed to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.

(8) If any person wilfully alters, suppresses, conceals or destroys any document which he may be required to produce under this section, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.

(ii) unless the document forms part of the records or other documents of a court or public authority, to transmit the document itself to the Commissioner for his inspection.

(2) The Commissioner shall be entitled without payment to keep any copy or extract furnished to him under subsection (1); and where a document transmitted to him for his inspection relates only to one or more charities and is not held by any person entitled as trustee or otherwise to the custody of the document, the Commissioner may keep it or may deliver it to the charity trustees or to any other person who may be so entitled.

(3) The Commissioner or any officer authorised by him in that behalf shall at all times have full and free access to all buildings, places, books, documents and other papers for the purpose of discharging his functions under this Act, and may, without payment, inspect, copy or make extracts from any such books, documents or papers.

(4) The Commissioner may take possession of any books, documents or papers where in his opinion —

(a) the inspection, copying thereof or extraction therefrom cannot reasonably be performed without taking possession;

(4) The charity trustees of a charity shall preserve —

(a) any statement of accounts prepared by them under subsection (1); or

for at least 5 years from the end of the financial year to which any such statement relates or to which any such account and statement relate, as the case may be.

## PART VI

APPLICATION OF PROPERTY CY-PRÈS AND ASSISTANCE AND SUPERVISION OF CHARITIES BY COURT AND COMMISSIONER

### Occasions for applying property cy-près

21\.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), the circumstances in which the original purposes of a charitable gift can be altered to allow the property given or part of it to be applied cy-près shall be as follows:

(a) where the original purposes, in whole or in part —

(i) have been as far as may be fulfilled; or

(ii) cannot be carried out, or not according to the directions given and to the spirit of the gift;

(b) where the original purposes provide a use for part only of the property available by virtue of the gift;

(c) where the property available by virtue of the gift and other property applicable for similar purposes can be more effectively used in conjunction and to that end can suitably, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, be made applicable to common purposes;

(d) where the original purposes were laid down by reference to an area which then was but has since ceased to be a unit for some other purpose, or by reference to a class of persons or to an area which has for any reason since ceased to be suitable, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, or to be practical in administering the gift; or

(e) where the original purposes, in whole or in part, have, since they were laid down —

(i) been adequately provided for by other means;

(ii) ceased, as being useless or harmful to the community or for other reasons, to be in law charitable; or

(iii) ceased in any other way to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property available by virtue of the gift, regard being had to the spirit of the gift.

(2) Subsection (1) shall not affect the conditions which must be satisfied in order that property given for charitable purposes may be applied cy-près, except in so far as those conditions require a failure of the original purposes.

(3) References in subsections (1) and (2) to the original purposes of a gift shall be construed, where the application of the property given has been altered or regulated by a scheme or otherwise, as referring to the purposes for which the property is for the time being applicable.

(4) It is hereby declared that a trust for charitable purposes places a trustee under a duty, where the case permits and requires the property of some part of it to be applied cy-près, to secure its effective use for charity by taking steps to enable it to be so applied.

(5) This section shall apply to property given for charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was so given before 1st January 1995.

### Application cy-près of gifts of donors unknown or disclaiming

22\.—(1) Property given for specific charitable purposes which fail shall be applicable cy-près as if given for charitable purposes generally, where it belongs to a donor who —

(a) after the prescribed advertisements and inquiries have been published and made, and after the prescribed period beginning with the publication of those advertisements has expired, cannot be identified or cannot be found; or

(b) has executed a disclaimer in the prescribed form of his right to have the property returned.

(2) Where the prescribed advertisements and inquiries have been published and made by or on behalf of trustees with respect to any such property, the trustees shall not be liable to pay to any person in respect of the property if no claim by him to be interested in the property is received by the trustees before the expiry of the period specified in subsection (1)(a).

(3) For the purposes of this section, property shall be conclusively presumed (without any advertisement or inquiry) to belong to donors who cannot be identified, in so far as it consists of the proceeds of —

(a) cash collections made by means of collecting boxes or by other means not adapted for distinguishing one gift from another; or

(b) any lottery, competition, entertainment, sale or similar money-raising activity, after allowing for property given to provide prizes or articles for sale or otherwise to enable the activity to be undertaken.

(4) The High Court may by order direct that property not falling within subsection (3) shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated (without any advertisement or inquiry) as belonging to donors who cannot be identified, where it appears to the Court —

(a) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the amounts likely to be returned to the donors, to incur expense with a view to returning the property; or

(b) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the nature, circumstances and amount of the gifts, and to the lapse of time since the gifts were made, for the donors to expect the property to be returned.

(5) Where property is applied cy-près by virtue of this section, the donor shall be deemed to have parted with all his interest at the time when the gift was made; but where property is so applied as belonging to donors who cannot be identified or cannot be found, and is not so applied by virtue of subsection (3) or (4) —

(a) the scheme shall specify the total amount of that property;

(b) the donor of any part of that amount shall be entitled, if he makes a claim not later than 6 months after the date on which the scheme is made, to recover from the charity for which the property is applied a sum equal to that part, less any expenses properly incurred by the charity trustees after that date in connection with claims relating to his gift; and

(c) the scheme may include directions as to the provision to be made for meeting any such claim.

(6) Where —

(a) any sum is, in accordance with any directions in a scheme, set aside for meeting any such claims; but

(b) the aggregate amount of any such claims actually made exceeds the relevant amount,

then if the Commissioner so directs, each of the donors in question shall be entitled only to such proportion of the relevant amount as the amount of his claim bears to the aggregate amount referred to in paragraph (b); and for this purpose, “relevant amount” means the amount of the sum so set aside after deduction of any expenses properly incurred by the charity trustees in connection with claims relating to the donors’ gifts.

(7) For the purposes of this section, charitable purposes shall be deemed to fail where any difficulty in applying property to those purposes makes that property or the part not applicable cy-près available to be returned to the donors.

(8) In this section, except in so far as the context otherwise requires, references to a donor include persons claiming through or under the original donor, and references to property given include the property for the time being representing the property originally given or property derived from it.

(9) This section shall apply to property given for charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was so given before 1st January 1995.

### Entrusting charity property to Public Trustee and termination of trust

23\.—(1) The High Court may by order vest any property held by or in trust for a charity in the Public Trustee or authorise or require the persons in whom the property is vested to transfer it to him, or appoint any person to transfer the property to him; and the property may be vested in the Public Trustee with or without powers of management as the Court may direct.

(2) Where any property is held by or in trust for a charity, or is comprised in any testamentary gift to a charity, the property may, with the agreement of the Public Trustee, be transferred to him; and his receipt for the property comprised in a testamentary gift to a charity shall be a complete discharge of the personal representative.

(3) Where property is vested in the Public Trustee in trust for a charity, the High Court may make an order discharging him from the trusteeship as respects all or any of that property.

(4) Where the Public Trustee is discharged from his trusteeship of any property, or the trusts on which he holds any property come to an end, the High Court may make such vesting orders and give such directions as may seem to the Court to be necessary or expedient in consequence.

(5) No person shall —

(a) be liable for any loss occasioned by his acting in conformity with an order under this section or by his giving effect to anything done in pursuance of that order; or

(b) be excused from so doing by reason of the order under this section having been in any respect improperly obtained.

(6) No vesting or transfer of any property in pursuance of this section shall operate as a breach of a covenant or condition against alienation or give rise to a forfeiture.

### Concurrent jurisdiction with High Court for certain purposes

24\.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Commissioner may, with the consent of the Attorney-General, by order exercise the same jurisdiction and powers as are exercisable by the High Court in charity proceedings for the following purposes:

(b) appointing, discharging or removing a charity trustee or trustee for a charity, or removing an officer or employee; and

(c) vesting or transferring property, or requiring or entitling any person to call for or make any transfer of property or any payment.

(2) The Commissioner shall not have jurisdiction under this section to try or determine the title to any property as between a charity or trustee for a charity and a person holding or claiming the property or an interest in it adversely to the charity, or to try or determine any question as to the existence or extent of any charge or trust.

(3) Before exercising any jurisdiction under this section, the Commissioner shall give notice of his intention to do so to each of the charity trustees except those who cannot be found or who have no known address in Singapore; and the notice may be given by post and, if given by post, may be addressed to the trustee’s last known address in Singapore.

(4) The Commissioner shall not exercise his jurisdiction under this section in any case (not referred to him by order of the court) which, by reason of its contentious character, or of any special question of law or of fact which it may involve, or for other reasons, the Commissioner may consider more fit to be adjudicated on by the court.

(5) An appeal against any order of the Commissioner under this section may at any time, within the 3 months beginning with the day following that on which the order is published, be brought in the High Court by the charity or any of the charity trustees, or any person interested in the charity, or by any person removed from any office or employment by the order.

### Power to act for protection of charities

25\.—(1) Where, at any time after the Commissioner has instituted an inquiry under section 8 with respect to any charity, he is satisfied —

(a) that there is or has been any misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of the charity; and

(b) that it is necessary or desirable to act for the purpose of protecting the property of the charity or securing a proper application for the purposes of the charity of that property or of property coming to the charity,

the Commissioner may, with the consent of the Attorney-General, do one or more of the following things:

the Commissioner may, with the consent of the Attorney-General, do one or more of the following things:

(i) by order suspend any trustee, charity trustee, officer, agent or employee of the charity from the exercise of his office or employment pending consideration being given to his removal (whether under this section or otherwise);

(ii) by order appoint such number of additional charity trustees as he considers necessary for the proper administration of the charity;

(3) The references in subsections (1) and (2) to misconduct or mismanagement shall (notwithstanding anything in the trusts of the charity) extend to the employment for remuneration or reward of persons acting in the affairs of the charity, or for other administrative purposes, of sums which are excessive in relation to the property which is or is likely to be applied or applicable for the purposes of the charity.

(4) The Commissioner may remove a charity trustee by order made of his own motion where the trustee —

(a) has been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, fraud or moral turpitude;

(b) is a bankrupt;

(c) is a corporation in liquidation;

(d) is incapable of acting by reason of mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act [Cap. 178];

(e) has not acted, and will not declare his willingness or unwillingness to act; or

(f) is outside Singapore or cannot be found or does not act, and his absence or failure to act impedes the proper administration of the charity.

(5) The Commissioner may, by order made of his own motion, appoint a person to be a charity trustee —

(a) in place of a charity trustee removed by him under this section or otherwise;

(b) where there are no charity trustees, or where by reason of vacancies in their number or the absence or incapacity of any of their number the charity cannot apply for the appointment;

(c) where there is a single charity trustee, not being a corporation, and the Commissioner is of the opinion that it is necessary to increase the number for the proper administration of the charity; or

(d) where the Commissioner is of the opinion that it is necessary for the proper administration of the charity to have an additional charity trustee, because one of the existing charity trustees who ought nevertheless to remain a charity trustee cannot be found or does not act or is outside Singapore.
