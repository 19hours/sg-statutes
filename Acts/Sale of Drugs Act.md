(3) In proceedings under this section it shall not be a defence that the purchaser bought for analysis and therefore was not prejudiced.

[12/73]

(3) For the purposes of this Act every person shall be deemed to sell or to intend to sell any drug if he sells or intends to sell for human consumption or use any article of which such drug is a constituent.

[21

[12/73]

### Reliance on written warranty a good defence

20\.—(1) Subject to this section, it shall be a good defence in any prosecution for an offence under section 10 if the defendant proves that —

(b) he had no reason to believe that the article sold did not conform to such warranty or statement; and

(c) if the article had truly conformed to such warranty or statement, the sale of the article by the defendant would not have constituted the offence charged against him.

(4) When the defendant is an employee or agent of the person who purchased the article under such a warranty or written statement, he shall be entitled to the benefit of this section in the same manner and to the same extent as his employer or principal would have been, if he had been the defendant; provided that the employee or agent further proves that he had no reason to believe that the article did not conform to the warranty or statement.

### Penalty for false warranty

(5) Any person who in respect of any drug sold by him as principal or agent gives to the purchaser a false warranty in writing shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and for any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding $4,000, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that when he gave the warranty he had reason to believe that the statements or descriptions contained therein were true.

[22

[12/73]

### Analyst’s certificate to be prima facie evidence

21\.—(1) The production by the prosecutor of a certificate of analysis purporting to be under the hand of an analyst shall be sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein, unless the defendant requires the analyst to be called as a witness, in which case he shall give notice thereof to the prosecutor not less than 3 clear days before the day on which the summons is returnable.

(2) In like manner the production by the defendant of a certificate of analysis purporting to be under the hand of an analyst shall be sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein, unless the prosecutor requires the analyst to be called as a witness.

(3) A copy of such last-mentioned certificate shall be sent to the prosecutor at least 3 clear days before the day fixed for the hearing of the summons, and, if it is not so sent, the Magistrate’s Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it thinks proper.

[12/73]
