and such ancillary orders as may be necessary to give effect to the order or orders made by the tribunal.

(2) The following provisions shall apply to an order made under subsection (1):

(a) an order made under subsection (1)(a) shall not require payment of money exceeding —

(i) the prescribed limit; or

(ii) where the claim has been heard and determined by the tribunal pursuant to an agreement between the parties thereto under section 5(4), the value of the claim;

[Act 17 of 1995 wef 15/08/1995]

(b) the value of the work required to be performed by the order shall not exceed —

(i) the prescribed limit; or

(2) Where application is made to a Magistrate’s Court for the issue of any process to enforce an order provided for by section 32(1)(c) (requiring a party to pay money to another as an alternative to compliance with a work order), the Registrar shall give notice of the application to the party against whom enforcement is sought.

(3) If that party does not file in the tribunal within the period prescribed for so doing a notice of objection in the prescribed form, the order may, after the expiry of that period, be enforced pursuant to subsection (1).

(4) The notice referred to in subsection (3) may only be given on the ground that it is the belief of the party that the order of the tribunal or the Registrar has been fully complied with and that he therefore disputes the entitlement of the applicant to enforce it.

[Act 31 of 1992 wef 13/11/1992]

(5) If the party against whom enforcement is sought files the notice referred to in subsection (3) within the prescribed period, the Registrar shall refer the matter to the tribunal to be heard and determined under section 34(2).

(6) No filing fee shall be payable by a person who seeks to enforce an order pursuant to subsection (1) but any fee which would otherwise be payable therefor shall be included in and be deemed as part of the award of the tribunal and shall be recoverable from the opposite party for the credit of the Consolidated Fund.

### Enforcement of work orders

(a) a party in whose favour a work order has been made considers that the work order has not been complied with by the other party; and

(b) that other party has not complied with the alternative money order provided for by section 32(1)(c),

the party in whose favour the work order was made may, instead of applying to a Magistrate’s Court for the issue of a process for enforcement pursuant to section 33(1), lodge with the tribunal a request in the prescribed form that the work order be enforced.

(2) Subsequent proceedings shall be taken on a request for enforcement under subsection (1) and on notice under section 33(5) as if such request or notice were a claim lodged under section 15; and upon the hearing of the matter the tribunal may —

(a) vary the work order, or make a further work order or any other order which is authorised by section 32;

(b) grant leave to the party in whose favour the work order was made to enforce the alternative money order provided for by section 32 or so much thereof as the tribunal may allow, and either subject to or without compliance with section 33(2); or

(c) discharge any order previously made by the tribunal.
