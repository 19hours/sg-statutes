[31/92]

(2) Where application is made to a Magistrate’s Court for the issue of any process to enforce an order provided for by section 35(1)(c) (requiring a party to pay money to another as an alternative to compliance with a work order), the Registrar shall give notice of the application to the party against whom enforcement is sought.

(3) If that party does not file in the tribunal within the period prescribed for so doing a notice of objection in the prescribed form, the order may, after the expiry of that period, be enforced pursuant to subsection (1).

(4) The notice referred to in subsection (3) may only be given on the ground that it is the belief of the party that the order of the tribunal or the Registrar has been fully complied with and that the party therefore disputes the entitlement of the applicant to enforce it.

[31/92]

(5) If the party against whom enforcement is sought files the notice referred to in subsection (3) within the prescribed period, the Registrar shall refer the matter to the tribunal to be heard and determined under section 37(3).

(6) No filing fee shall be payable by a person who seeks to enforce an order pursuant to subsection (1) but any fee which would otherwise be payable therefor shall be included in and be deemed as part of the award of the tribunal and shall be recoverable from the opposite party for the credit of the Consolidated Fund.

(b) that other party has not complied with the alternative money order provided for by section 35(1)(c),

the party in whose favour the work order was made may, instead of applying to a Magistrate’s Court for the issue of a process for enforcement pursuant to section 36(1), lodge with the tribunal a request in the prescribed form that the work order be enforced.

(2) Subsequent proceedings shall be taken on a request for enforcement under subsection (1) and on notice under section 36(5) as if such request or notice were a claim lodged under section 15.

(3) Upon the hearing of the matter, the tribunal may —

(a) vary the work order, or make a further work order or any other order which is authorised by section 35;

(b) grant leave to the party in whose favour the work order was made to enforce the alternative money order provided for by section 35 or so much thereof as the tribunal may allow, and either subject to or without compliance with section 36(2); or
