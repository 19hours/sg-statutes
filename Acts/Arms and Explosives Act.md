[30

### Search for arms, etc.

32\.—(1) The licensing authority may authorise, by writing, any police officer to search any house or the houses in any district for any guns, arms, explosives or poisonous or noxious gas , and may in like manner authorise the police officer to require any person or the persons living in any district to produce his or their licence or licences for the possession of guns, arms, explosives or poisonous or noxious gas, and to produce or account for the things covered thereby.

[21/73]

(2) Any person who fails to give a satisfactory account to the police officer for any guns, arms, explosives or poisonous or noxious gas in his possession or under his control during the existence or after the expiry, suspension or cancellation of a licence shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100.

[31

### Search of vessels or aircraft

33\.—(1) If any vessel or aircraft, about to leave any port of Singapore —

(a) is suspected of having on board any article, the exportation or removal of which is absolutely prohibited by a notification issued under this Act, and which is not exempted by this Act or by any licence issued under this Act;

(b) bound for any particular country, territory or place, is suspected of having on board any article the exportation of which to that country, territory or place is so prohibited, and which is not exempted as aforesaid;

(c) is suspected of having on board any article which is intended to be exported or removed contrary to this Act; or

(d) is suspected of having on board any guns, arms, explosives or naval or military stores for the exportation of which no licence has been issued,

the Port Master or the licensing authority may issue a search warrant directed to any boarding officer or boarding officers or any police officer named or referred to in the warrant.

(a) board any vessel or aircraft named or described in the warrant either with or without assistants;

(b) forcibly enter every part of that vessel or aircraft; and

(c) arrest any person reasonably suspected of being guilty of an offence under this Act.

(3) The Port Master or the licensing authority may himself do what he may authorise a police officer to do under this section in either of the following cases:

(a) if he has personal knowledge of such facts as satisfy him that there are sufficient grounds for a search;

(b) if he receives information orally and either on oath or not on oath in such circumstances that the object of a search would in his opinion be defeated by the delay necessary for reducing the information to writing provided that the name and address of the person giving the information is known to or ascertained by him before he acts upon the information.

(4) If, upon any search made under this section —

(a) any article, the exportation or removal of which is absolutely prohibited by any notification issued under this Act, and which is not exempted by this Act or by any licence issued under this Act, is found on board any vessel or aircraft about to leave any port of Singapore;

(b) any article, the exportation of which to any particular country, territory or place is prohibited by any such notification, and which is not exempted as aforesaid, is found on board any vessel or aircraft about to leave any port of Singapore for that country, territory or place; or

it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the article was attempted to be exported or removed contrary to this Act, or that the article was attempted to be exported without a licence, as the case may be, and that vessel or aircraft may be detained for the purpose of removing that article therefrom, and the article may be removed.

### Persons conveying arms, etc., may be apprehended without warrant in suspicious circumstances

34\.—(1) If any person is found carrying or conveying any guns, arms, naval or military stores or explosives in such a manner or under such circumstances as to afford reasonable grounds for suspicion that they may be used for any unlawful purpose dangerous to the public peace, any person may without warrant apprehend the person so found and detain him in custody.

(2) Any person who is apprehended by a person not being a police officer shall be forthwith taken to the nearest or other police station or be handed over to a police officer.
