### When post-mortem examination is held

20\. When a medical practitioner has made a post-mortem examination of the body of any deceased person, the medical practitioner shall, unless he knows that a Coroner’s inquest or inquiry is to be held in respect of the death, within 24 hours after the conclusion of the examination, forward a certificate in the prescribed form to any deputy registrar of the local registration area within which the body of the deceased person was found, and the cause of death as stated in the certificate shall be entered in the register.

### Duty of Coroners as to findings

21\.—(1) When an inquest or inquiry is held on the body of any deceased person the Coroner shall, within 48 hours after the conclusion of the inquest or inquiry, forward to any deputy registrar of the local registration area within which the body of the deceased person was found a certificate setting forth the cause of death as ascertained at the inquest or inquiry and such other particulars as are required for the purpose of registration and the cause of death in the certificate shall be entered in the register.

(2) When before the commencement or conclusion of an inquest or inquiry the Coroner issues a certificate authorising the burial of the body of any deceased person upon whom an inquiry or inquest is being or is to be held, he shall send a copy of the certificate to any deputy registrar of the local registration area within which the body of the deceased person was found and the deputy registrar shall enter in the prescribed form the cause of death as stated in the certificate.

### Duties of police officers

22\.—(1) All police officers shall obtain information of every birth and death within their respective districts, and also information respecting the father and mother of every child born in their district, and respecting the occupier of any house in their district in which any birth or death happens, and give notice thereof to the registrar or deputy registrar of the local registration area.

(2) Any police officer who knows such particulars and wilfully omits or neglects to give notice thereof to the proper registrar or the deputy registrar shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100.

### Late registration

23\.—(1) Notwithstanding the neglect of any person to report or furnish information as to any birth or any death within the time required by this Act, it shall be the duty of the registrar or the deputy registrar to procure by all means within his power the best and most accurate information respecting any birth or death which has occurred within his area, and upon such information he shall make an entry of the birth or death in the manner hereinafter mentioned but not, in any case, until after the expiry of 42 days after the birth or 3 days after the death, as the case may be:

Provided that after the expiration of 12 months next after the birth of any child or after the expiration of one week next after any death or after the finding of any dead body elsewhere than in a house, the birth or death shall not be registered except with the written authority of the Registrar-General, who may in his discretion refuse or grant authorisation for registration in the manner in this section provided, and a note of the authorisation (if granted) shall be made in the register.

(2) Every such entry shall be made in a register specially kept for late registration, to be called the late register, and subject to subsections (3) and (4), section 25 shall apply to certified extracts of such entries in the like manner as they apply to certified extracts from an ordinary register.

(3) Every copy of an entry in a late register shall be in a form readily distinguishable from all other certified extracts, and shall have printed on it conspicuously the words “LATE REGISTRATION” and no copy so marked shall be receivable in evidence, as prescribed in section 25 unless the truth of the facts therein entered shall have been found by a Magistrate’s Court in a proceeding instituted before it under this section and the court has certified its findings in the register. Such a proceeding may be instituted by any person claiming to have an interest in substantiating the record and shall be brought by way of information and summons to be served on the registrar calling upon him to show cause why a certified copy of the entry should not be entitled to be received in evidence in the manner and to the extent provided by section 25.

(4) Where, under the provisions of the Legitimacy Act [Cap. 162] or any regulations made thereunder, any late register is used for the purpose of registering the birth of a legitimated person, every copy or extract of any entry relating to the re-registration, certified under the hand of the registrar for the time being to be a true copy or extract, shall be prima facie evidence in all courts and before all tribunals of the dates and facts contained or set forth in the copy or extract.

(5) The fact that any birth or death has been recorded or permitted to be recorded under subsection (1) or authenticated by a Magistrate’s Court under subsection (3) shall not affect the liability of any person to punishment under section 18.

### Correction of errors

24\.—(1) No alteration shall be made in any register except as authorised by this Act or by the Legitimacy Act.

(2) Except as provided in subsection (4), any clerical error which may be discovered in any register shall be corrected by a registrar who shall initial the entry in which the error has been discovered.

(3) Any error of fact or substance in any register may be corrected by entry (but so that no alteration of the original entry is made) by a registrar on payment of the prescribed fee and on the production to him by the person requiring the error to be corrected, of a statutory declaration setting forth the nature of the error and the facts of the case, and made by two persons required by this Act to give information concerning the birth or death with reference to which the error was made, or, in default of such persons, then by two credible persons to the satisfaction of the registrar having knowledge of the truth of the case, and the registrar shall initial the entry and shall add thereto the day and the month and the year when the correction is made.

(4) Any clerical error in any register relating to any death registered on a certificate issued by a Coroner may on the receipt of a certificate or an amended certificate from the Coroner setting forth the nature of the error and authorising the correction of the entry, be corrected by a registrar, who shall place his initials opposite the entry in which the error occurred and shall add thereto the day and the month and the year when the correction is made.

(5) Any error of fact or substance in any register in connection with any death registered on a certificate issued by a Coroner may on receipt of a certificate or amended certificate from the Coroner setting forth the nature of the error and the facts of the case, be corrected by an entry (but so that no alteration of the original entry is made) by a registrar who shall add to such note or entry the words “Corrected by me on the authority of a certificate from the Coroner” and shall sign such note or entry and shall add thereto the day and the month and the year the correction is made.

(6) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (5) in any case —

(a) where any entry has been made in any register using a Japanese date or place name the registrar may alter the date or place name to accord with the English calendar and the place name used prior to the Japanese substitution and shall initial any such alteration when made; or

(b) where any entry relating to nationality has been made in any register and the entry does not for any reason accord with the entry which should have been made had Singapore not been occupied by the Japanese the registrar may substitute for that entry the entry which should have been so made and shall initial any such substitution.

### Extracts from registers

25\.—(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and subject to section 23, every registrar shall, upon receiving an application therefor and upon payment of the prescribed fees, furnish to any person applying for it a certified extract of any entry in any register, other than a register of still births, in his charge.

(2) Every such application shall be made to the registrar of the local registration area in which the birth or death was registered, and shall be made on the form prescribed for that purpose.

(3) When an application for a certified extract has been made in accordance with this section, it shall be lawful for the registrar to refuse to furnish such extract if and so long as —

(a) the particulars given in the application form are incomplete or inadequate or in his opinion inaccurate;

(b) for any reason it appears to him that an entry found upon search cannot with certainty be connected with the person in respect of the registration of whose birth or death the certified extract is applied for; or

(c) the birth has been registered subsequent to the commencement of this Act and the name of the person in respect of whose birth the extract is applied for has not been registered:

Provided that in every such case the registrar shall furnish in writing to the person applying for the extract the reason for his refusal.

(4) When a registrar has refused to furnish a certified extract under this section, the person applying for the extract may appeal to the Registrar-General and from him to the Minister, whose decision shall be final, on the ground that he has supplied sufficient information to enable the registrar to furnish the extract; and the Registrar-General or the Minister may thereupon direct the registrar to make further search.

(5) Every copy or extract of any entry in any register at each local registration area certified under the hand of the registrar for that area for the time being to be a true copy or extract shall, subject to the limitation provided in section 23(3), be prima facie evidence in all courts and before all tribunals of the dates and facts set forth in such copy or extract:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to any copy or extract of any entry in which the name of the person born has not been registered.

(6) A registrar may in furnishing any copy or extract of any entry under subsection (1) translate into English any entry made in any other language and subsection (5) shall apply to every copy or extract so translated.
