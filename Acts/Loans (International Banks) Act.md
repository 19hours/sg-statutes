### Powers exercisable by Government in event or prospect of default by statutory authority

9\.—(1) Where it is made to appear to the President that there is reasonable cause to believe —

(2) The statutory authority shall notwithstanding any provision in the written law by which it is established comply with any directions given by or under any such order.

10\.—(1) If any sum is paid out of the Consolidated Fund in respect of any liability incurred by the Government under a guarantee or other undertaking given in exercise of the powers conferred by section 7(1) in respect of any borrowing by a statutory authority the statutory authority shall repay that sum (together with interest on it at the same rate as that payable on the loan under the agreement by the statutory authority with the Bank) to the Consolidated Fund in such manner and at such time or by such instalments as the Minister may direct.

(2) If any sum is so paid out of the Consolidated Fund the Minister shall, as soon as possible after the end of each financial year beginning with that in which the sum was paid and ending with that in which all liability in respect of it and any interest payable on it is finally discharged by the statutory authority concerned, present to Parliament a statement relating to it.

### Arbitration

11\. If any dispute between the Bank on the one part and the Government or a statutory authority or both on the other part arises under any agreement concluded or guarantee or undertaking given in exercise of the powers conferred by this Act or under any bond, promissory note or other instrument issued pursuant to any such agreement it shall be determined by arbitration in the manner agreed between the parties, and any award made in the arbitration shall be enforceable in Singapore in all respects as if it had been validly made in an arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration Act [Cap. 10] or any other written law relating to arbitration for the time being in force in Singapore, and for the purposes of this section the provisions of that Act or law shall be binding on the Government.
