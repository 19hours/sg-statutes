An Ordinance to incorporate the General of the Salvation Army as a Corporation sole having perpetual succession and to vest the property of the Salvation Army in the Straits Settlements in such Corporation.

Whereas by a Deed Poll (hereinafter called “the Deed of Constitution”) dated the 7th day of August 1878 and under the hand and seal of William Booth (the founder and General Superintendent of a Religious Society or Organisation known as “the Christian Mission”) and afterwards enrolled in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in England the origin name doctrines and purposes of the said Christian Mission were recited and stated:

And Whereas at some time before the 24th day of June 1880, the name of the said Religious Society or Organisation was changed from “the Christian Mission” to “The Salvation Army” as appears by a Memorandum of that date under the hand of the said William Booth endorsed on the Deed of Constitution and afterwards enrolled in the Central Office of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England:

And Whereas the said Religious Society or Organisation has since been and is now known as The Salvation Army and the General Superintendent thereof has since been and is now known as The General of the Salvation Army:

And Whereas by a Deed Poll (hereinafter called “the Deed of Constitution”) dated the 26th day of July 1904, under the hand and seal of the said William Booth and afterwards enrolled in the Central Office of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England the provisions of the Deed of Constitution were supplemented by provisions dealing with matters and contingencies not taken account of in the Deed of Constitution:

And Whereas by a Deed Poll dated the 21st day of November 1930, under the hand and seal of Edward John Higgins and afterwards enrolled in the Central Office of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England the provisions of the Supplemental Deed of Constitution were (pursuant to a power in that behalf thereby reserved) added to and varied:

And Whereas Evangeline Booth has been duly appointed and still is the General of the Salvation Army:

And Whereas the said Evangeline Booth has acquired certain movable property in the Colony for the purposes of and upon trust for the Salvation Army and it is expedient that provision be made for the vesting of such movable property in a corporation sole having perpetual succession for the benefit of and upon trust for the Salvation Army:

And Whereas it is expedient for the furtherance of the work carried on by the Salvation Army that immovable property in this Colony be acquired and that provision be made for the vesting of such immovable property to be so acquired in a corporation sole having perpetual succession for the benefit of and upon trust for the Salvation Army:
