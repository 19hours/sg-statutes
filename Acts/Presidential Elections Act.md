(c) that the offences mentioned in the said report were of a trivial, unimportant and limited character; and

(b) that the act or omission arose from inadvertence or from accidental miscalculations or from some other reasonable cause of a like nature, and in any case did not arise from any want of good faith,

and in the circumstances it seems to the Judge, after giving the candidates, the Returning Officer, and any elector within the electoral division an opportunity of being heard, to be just that the candidate in question and the election and other agent and person, or any of them, should not be subject to any of the consequences under this Act of that act or omission, the Judge may make an order allowing that act or omission to be an exception from the provisions of this Act which would otherwise make the act or omission an illegal practice, payment, employment or hiring, and thereupon the candidate, agent or person shall not be subject to any of the consequences under this Act of that act or omission.

[Act 12/93 wef 16/04/1993 vide S 115/93]

(b) if the election agent of the candidate applies to an Election Judge and shows that the failure to transmit the return and statements which he was required to transmit, or any part thereof, or any error or false statement therein, arose by reason of his illness, or of the death, illness or misconduct of any prior election agent of the candidate, or of the absence, death, illness or misconduct of any clerk, or officer of an election agent of the candidate, or by reason of inadvertence or of any reasonable cause of a like nature, and not by reason of any want of good faith on the part of the applicant,

[Act 12/93 wef 16/04/1993 vide S 115/93]

the Judge may, after such notice of the application, and on production of such evidence of the grounds stated in the application, and of the good faith of the application, and otherwise, as to the Judge seems fit, and after giving the other candidates, the Returning Officer and any elector an opportunity of being heard, make such order for allowing an authorised excuse for the failure to transmit such return and statements, or for an error or false statement in such return and statements as to the Judge seems just.

(2) Where it appears to the Judge that any person being or having been an election agent has refused or failed to make such return or supply such particulars as will enable any candidate and his election agent, respectively, to comply with the provisions of this Act as to the return and statements respecting election expenses, the Judge shall, before making an order allowing the excuse mentioned in this section, order the person to attend before the Judge, and shall, unless the person attends and shows cause to the contrary, order the person to make the return and statements, or to deliver a statement of the particulars required to be contained in the return, as to the Judge appears just, and to make or deliver them within such time and to such other person and in such manner as the Judge may direct, or may order the person to be examined with respect to those particulars, and, in default of compliance with that order, the person shall be guilty of an illegal practice.

(3) The order may make the allowance conditional upon the making of the return and statements in a modified form or within an extended time, and upon the compliance with such other terms as to the Judge seems best calculated for carrying into effect the objects of this Act; and an order allowing an authorised excuse shall relieve the applicant for the order from any liability or consequences under this Act in respect of the matter excused by the order; and where it is proved by the candidate to the Judge that any act or omission of the election agent in relation to the return and statements respecting election expenses was without the sanction or connivance of the candidate, and that the candidate took all reasonable means for preventing the act or omission, the Judge shall relieve the candidate from the consequences of the act or omission on the part of his his election agent.
