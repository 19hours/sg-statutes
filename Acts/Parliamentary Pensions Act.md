(c) who, being an elected Member on 1st January 1995, becomes —

(i) a non-constituency Member or nominated Member at any time after 1st January 1995 with or without a break in his service as a Member; or

(ii) an elected Member at any time after 1st January 1995 with a break in his service as a Member after that date,

and for the purposes of paragraph (c) of this definition, a Member’s service shall be deemed not broken but continuous if, following the dissolution of Parliament or his seat therein becoming vacant under the provisions of the Constitution, he is elected as a Member at the ensuing general election or the ensuing by-election to fill that vacancy;

[Act 13 of 1995 wef 01/01/1995]

(3) Where a Speaker is not, or has not been, an elected Member of Parliament for any period, “salary” shall, for that period, mean the salary payable to him in respect of his service as Speaker.

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where for any period a person who is eligible for any pension or other benefit under this Act voluntarily refrains from receiving the whole or any part of any salary due to him in respect of the office held by him, then, in calculating his pension or benefit he shall, for such period, be deemed to have received the full salary to which he was entitled as holder of that office.
