Provided that no compensation shall be payable by reason of the operation of a general order under this section prohibiting flying in Singapore or any part thereof.

### Prohibited carriage and prohibited photography over protected areas

7\.—(1) The Minister may by order published in theGazettedeclare any area to be a protected area within the meaning of this section.

(2) An aircraft flying over any protected area shall not carry —

(a) arms or explosives (other than such arms and ammunition therefor as may be permitted by rules made under the Arms and Explosives Act [Cap. 13], and in respect of which all conditions prescribed in such rules are observed), or munitions of war (including gas in any form suitable for warlike purposes), save for the purposes of the provisions of any order made under section 3 relating to signals; or

(b) photographic apparatus, unless packed in such a manner that it cannot be used in the aircraft, and sealed by the person in charge of the aircraft before the aircraft flies over that protected area:

Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to photographic apparatus allowed to be used by a person in accordance with the terms of a permit issued to him under subsection (3).

(3)(a) No person shall take from an aircraft any photograph of a protected area except in accordance with the terms and conditions in such permit as the Authority may see fit to issue to him.

(2) The purposes for which the Minister may acquire land under this section shall include the purpose of securing that the land adjacent to the site of an aerodrome, which the Minister has established or is about to establish, shall not be used in such manner as to cause interference with, or danger or damage to, aircraft at, or approaching or leaving the aerodrome.

### Trespass, nuisance and responsibility for damage

9\.—(1) No action shall lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance, by reason only of the flight of aircraft over any property at a height above the ground which, having regard to wind, weather, and all the circumstances of the case is reasonable, or the ordinary incidents of the flight, so long as the provisions of this Part and any subsidiary legislation made under this Part are duly complied with; but where material damage or loss is caused by an aircraft in flight, taking off, or landing, or by any person in any such aircraft, or by any article falling from any such aircraft, to any person or property on land or water, damages shall be recoverable from the owner of the aircraft in respect of the damage or loss, without proof of negligence or intention or other cause of action, as though the same had been caused by his wilful act, neglect or default, except where the damage or loss was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the person by whom the same was suffered:

Provided that where material damage or loss is caused as aforesaid in circumstances in which —

(a) damages are recoverable from the owner in respect of the damage or loss by virtue only of this section; and

(b) a legal liability is created in some person other than the owner to pay damages in respect of that damage or loss,

the owner shall be entitled to be indemnified by that other person against any claim in respect of that damage or loss.

(2) Where any aircraft has been bona fide demised, let, or hired out for a period exceeding 14 days to any other person by the owner thereof and no pilot, commander, navigator, or operative member of the crew of the aircraft is in the employment of the owner, this section shall have effect as though for references to the owner there were substituted references to the person to whom the aircraft has been so demised, let, or hired out.

### Penalty for dangerous flying

10\.—(1) Where an aircraft is flown in such a manner as to be the cause of unnecessary danger to any person or property on land or water, the pilot or the person in charge of the aircraft, and also the owner thereof, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that the aircraft was so flown without his actual fault or privity, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.

For the purposes of this section, “owner” in relation to an aircraft includes any person by whom the aircraft is hired at the time of the offence.

(2) This section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any provisions made by the Minister under the powers conferred by section 3.

### Wreck and salvage

11\.—(1) Any services rendered in assisting, or in saving life from, or in saving the cargo or apparel of, an aircraft in, on or over the sea or any tidal water, or on or over the shores of the sea or any tidal water, shall be deemed to be salvage services in all cases in which they would have been salvage services if they had been rendered in relation to a vessel; and where salvage services are rendered by an aircraft to any property or person, the owner of the aircraft shall be entitled to the same reward for those services as he would have been entitled to if the aircraft had been a vessel.

(2) Subsection (1) shall have effect notwithstanding that the aircraft concerned is a foreign aircraft, and notwithstanding that the services in question are rendered elsewhere than within the limits of the territorial waters adjacent to any part of Singapore.

(3) The Minister may, by regulations, direct that any provisions of any written law for the time being in force which relate to wreck, to salvage of life or property or to the duty of rendering assistance to vessels in distress shall, with such exceptions, adaptations and modifications, if any, as may be specified in the regulations, apply in relation to aircraft as those provisions apply in relation to vessels.

(4) For the purposes of this section, any provisions of any written law which relate to vessels laid by or neglected as unfit for sea service shall be deemed to be provisions relating to wreck.

### Power to provide for investigation of accidents

12\.—(1) The Minister may make regulations providing for the investigation of any accident arising out of or in the course of air navigation and occurring in or over Singapore or to Singapore aircraft occurring elsewhere and likely in the absence of such provision to remain uninvestigated.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations made under this section may contain provisions —

(a) requiring notice to be given of any such accident as aforesaid in such manner and by such persons as may be specified;

(b) applying, with or without modification, for the purpose of investigations held with respect to any such accident any of the provisions of any written law in force in Singapore relating to the investigation of deaths or accidents;

(c) prohibiting, pending investigation, access to or interference with aircraft to which an accident has occurred, and authorising any person, so far as may be necessary for the purposes of an investigation, to have access to, examine, remove, take measures for the preservation of, or otherwise deal with any such aircraft;

(d) authorising or requiring the cancellation, suspension, endorsement, or surrender of any licence or certificate granted under this Part or any subsidiary legislation made under this Part, where it appears on an investigation that the licence ought to be cancelled, suspended, endorsed, or surrendered, and for the production of any such licence for the purpose of being so dealt with.

(3) Nothing in this section shall limit the powers of any authority to investigate accidents under any written law for the time being in force relating to merchant shipping.

(4) If any person contravenes or fails to comply with any regulations made under this section, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.

### Detention of aircraft

13\. Any order or regulations made under this Part in relation to aircraft may provide for the detention of aircraft to secure compliance with the order or regulations, as the case may be, or with any provisions of this Part in connection with which the order or regulations is or are made, and may make such further provision as appears to the Minister to be necessary or expedient for securing the detention.

### Provisions as to orders

14\.—(1) Notwithstanding that an order made under section 3 or any regulations made under such order has effect only as part of the law of Singapore, no provision contained in the order or regulations shall, on the ground that it would have extra-territorial operation, be deemed to be invalid in so far as it applies to Singapore aircraft, wherever they may be, or prohibits, requires or regulates —

(a) the doing of anything by persons in, or any of the personnel of, Singapore aircraft, wherever they may be; or

(b) the doing of anything in relation to Singapore aircraft by other persons being citizens of Singapore or citizens of any Commonwealth country, wherever they may be.

(2) For the purposes of this section the personnel of an aircraft shall be deemed to include the commander or other person in charge of the aircraft, and all other members of the crew of the aircraft.

(ii) who is the holder of a licence in respect of a customs aerodrome,

to furnish to such authorities as may be specified in the regulations such information relating to the use of aircraft for the purpose of his business and to the persons employed in connection with that use, or, as the case may be, relating to the use of the aerodrome and to the persons employed in aircraft arriving thereat or departing therefrom, as may be prescribed by the regulations;

(b) requiring the owner, or the pilot or other person in charge, of any aircraft arriving at, or departing from, any customs aerodrome to furnish to the holder of the licence in respect of that aerodrome such information as may be necessary to enable the holder of the licence to comply with such of the provisions of the regulations as relate to him;

(c) prescribing the times at which, and the form and manner in which, any information required under the regulations is to be furnished:

Provided that a person carrying on such a business as is mentioned in paragraph (a)(i) shall not be required to furnish information relating to the use of aircraft on journeys wholly outside Singapore, or relating to persons exclusively employed outside Singapore, unless the person carrying on the business is either a citizen of Singapore or of a Commonwealth country or a body corporate incorporated under the law of Singapore.

(2) Regulations made under this section may provide for imposing on any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of the regulations such penalties (not exceeding a fine of $500 and a further fine of $100 for every day during which the contravention or non-compliance continues after conviction) as may be specified in the regulations.

(3) No information with respect to any particular undertaking which has been obtained by virtue of regulations made under this section shall, without the consent of the person carrying on that undertaking, be disclosed otherwise than in connection with the execution of such regulations, and if any person discloses any such information in contravention of this subsection, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.

(4) Nothing in subsection (3) shall apply to the disclosure of any information for the purposes of any legal proceedings which may be taken by virtue of this subsection or of regulations made under this section, or for the purpose of any report of any such proceedings, but, save as aforesaid, the restriction imposed by this subsection shall, in relation to any legal proceedings (including arbitrations), extend so as to prohibit and prevent any person who is in possession of any such information so obtained from disclosing, and from being required by any court or arbitrator to disclose that information (whether as a witness or otherwise) except with the consent of the person carrying on the undertaking to which the information relates.

(5) In this section,

“customs aerodrome” means an aerodrome for the time being appointed as a place of landing and departure of aircraft for the purposes of any written law relating to customs.

[16

(e) as to the information to be furnished by an applicant for, or the holder of, such a licence to such authorities as may be specified in the regulations;

(f) prescribing the fees to be paid in respect of the grant of any licence under the regulations,

Provided that no person shall be liable to any penalty under this section unless it is proved that, at the material time, notices warning trespassers of their liability under this section were posted, so as to be readily seen and read by members of the public, in such positions on or near the boundary of the aerodrome as appear to the court to be proper.

[18

## PART III

CONTROL OF OBSTRUCTIONS IN VICINITY OF AERODROMES

### Indication of presence of obstructions near aerodromes

18\.—(1) If the Minister is satisfied, with respect to any structure in the vicinity of an aerodrome to which this section applies, that, in order to avoid danger to aircraft flying in that vicinity in darkness or conditions of poor visibility, provision ought to be made (whether by lighting or otherwise) for giving to the aircraft warning of the presence of that structure, he may by order authorise (subject to any conditions specified in the order) the proprietor of the aerodrome, and any person acting under the proprietor’s instructions —

(a) to execute, install, maintain, operate, and, as occasion requires, repair and alter, such works and apparatus as may be necessary for enabling such warning to be given in the manner specified in the order; and

(b) so far as may be necessary for exercising any of the powers conferred by the order to enter upon and pass over (with or without vehicles) any such land as may be specified in the order:

Provided that no such order shall be made in relation to any structure if it appears to the Minister that there have been made, and are being carried out, satisfactory arrangements for the giving of such warning as aforesaid of the presence of the structure.

(2) The Minister shall, before making any such order, cause to be published, in such manner as he thinks best for informing persons concerned, notice of the proposal to make the order and of the place where copies of the draft order may be obtained free of charge, and take into consideration any representations with respect to the order which may, within such period not being less than two months after the publication of the notice as may be specified therein, be made to him by any person appearing to him to have an interest in any land which would be affected by the order; and at the end of that period the order may, subject to this section, be made with such modifications (if any) of the original draft as the Minister thinks proper.

(3) Every such order as aforesaid shall provide —

(a) that, except in a case of emergency, no works shall be executed on any land in pursuance of the order, unless, at least 14 days previously, the proprietor of the aerodrome to which the order relates has served in the manner prescribed by the order on the occupier of that land, and on every other person known by the proprietor to have an interest therein, a written notice containing such particulars of the nature of the proposed works, and the manner in which and the time at which it is proposed to execute them, as may be prescribed by or in accordance with the order;

(b) that if, within 14 days after service of such notice on any person having such an interest, the proprietor of the aerodrome receives a written intimation of objection on the part of that person to the proposals contained in the notice, being an intimation which specifies the grounds of objection, then, unless and except in so far as the objection is withdrawn, no steps shall be taken in pursuance of the notice without the specific sanction of the Minister; and
