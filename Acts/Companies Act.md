(a) at the time of the issue of the debentures the assets of the corporation which constituted or were intended to constitute the security therefor were sufficient or likely to become sufficient to discharge the principal debt and any interest thereon;

(b) the security, if realised under the circumstances existing at the time of the application, would be likely to bring not more than 60% of the principal sum of moneys outstanding (regard being had to all prior charges and charges ranking pari passu if any); and

(c) the assets covered by the security, on a fair valuation on the basis of a going concern after allowing a reasonable amount for depreciation are worth less than the principal sum and the borrowing corporation is not making sufficient profit to pay the interest due on the principal sum or (where no definite rate of interest is payable) interest thereon at such rate as the Court considers would be a fair rate to expect from a similar investment.

(2) Subsection (1) shall not affect any power to vary rights or accept any compromise or arrangement created by the terms of the debentures or the relevant trust deed or under a compromise or arrangement between the borrowing corporation and creditors.

(3) Subsection (1) shall not apply in relation to any debenture that is offered to the public for subscription or purchase.

(2) Every officer and agent of a corporation the affairs of which are being investigated under this Part shall, if required by an inspector appointed under this Part, produce to the inspector all books and documents in his custody or power and shall give to the inspector all assistance in connection with the investigation which he is reasonably able to give.

(3) An inspector may, by notice in the prescribed form, require any officer or agent of any corporation whose affairs are being investigated pursuant to this Part to appear for examination on oath or affirmation (which he is hereby authorised to administer) in relation to its business; and the notice may require the production of all books and documents in the custody or under the control of that officer or agent.

(4) An inspector who, pursuant to this section, requires the production of all books and documents in the custody or power or under the control of an officer or agent of any corporation whose affairs are being investigated under or pursuant to this Part —

(a) may take possession of all such books and documents;

[13/87]

(5) If any officer or agent of any corporation, the affairs of which are being investigated pursuant to this Part, fails to comply with the requirements of any notice issued under subsection (3) or fails or refuses to answer any question which is put to him by an inspector with respect to the affairs of the corporation or that officer or agent is a director or past director to whom subsection (4A) applies, if he fails to comply with a requirement of an inspector under that subsection, the inspector may certify the failure or refusal under his hand to the Court, which may thereupon inquire into the case and, after hearing any witnesses against or on behalf of the alleged offender and any statement offered in defence, punish the offender in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of the Court.

[13/87]

(6) No person, who is or has formerly been an officer or agent of a corporation the affairs of which are being investigated under this Part, shall be entitled to refuse to answer any question which is relevant or material to the investigation on the ground that his answer might tend to incriminate him but if he claims that the answer to any question, might incriminate him and but for this subsection he would have been entitled to refuse to answer the question, the answer to the question shall not be used in any subsequent criminal proceedings except in the case of a charge against him for making a false statement in answer to that question.

(3) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar under subsection (1) or (2) may, within 30 days after the date of the decision, appeal to the Minister whose decision is final.

(b) if the foreign corporate entity was registered as a foreign company under Division 2 of Part XI immediately before that date, ceases to be so registered under Division 2 of that Part.

(a) create a new legal entity;

(b) prejudice or affect the identity of the body corporate constituted by the foreign corporate entity or its continuity as a body corporate;

(c) affect the property, or the rights or obligations, of the foreign corporate entity; or

(d) render defective any legal proceedings by or against the foreign corporate entity,

### Duty of company to register pre‑existing charges

(5) To avoid doubt, a failure to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the continuity of status, operation or effect of any security, right, priority or obligation of the charge.

(6) The Court, on being satisfied —

(a) that the omission to register a charge requiring registration under subsection (1), or that the omission or mis‑statement of any particular with respect to such charge, was accidental or due to inadvertence or to some other sufficient cause or is not of a nature to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders; or

(b) that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief,

may on the application of the company or any person interested and on such terms and conditions as seem to the Court just and expedient (including a term or condition that the rectification is to be without prejudice to any liability already incurred by the company or any of its officers in respect of the default) order that the time for registration be extended or that the omission or mis‑statement be rectified.

(7) In respect of any charge that is required to be lodged under subsection (1), sections 134, 135, 136 and 138 apply as if the charge were a charge to which Division 8 of Part IV applied.

(3) Any share warrant, stating that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares specified in the warrant and enabling the shares to be transferred by delivery of the warrant, that had been issued by the foreign corporate entity before the date of registration of the company is void.

(4) If any company on which a notice has been served requiring the company to make good any default in complying with this section fails to make good the default within 10 days after the service of the notice, the Court may, on the application of the person entitled to have the certificates or the debentures delivered to him, make an order directing the company and any officer of the company to make good the default within such time as is specified in the order, and the order may provide that all costs of and incidental to the application are to be borne by the company or by any officer of the company in default in such proportions as the Court thinks fit.
