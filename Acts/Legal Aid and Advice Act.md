(ii) that the disposable income of the applicant does not exceed the amount set out in the Second Schedule.

(3) The Director may refuse legal aid if it appears to him unreasonable that the applicant should receive it in the particular circumstances of the case.

(4) The reference in subsection (3) to property recovered or preserved for any person shall include his rights under any settlement or compromise arrived at to avoid or to bring to an end the proceedings and any sums recovered by virtue of an order for costs made in his favour in the proceedings (not being sums payable to the Director under section 14 or 16).

(5) The charge created by subsection (4) on any damages or costs shall not prevent a court allowing them to be set off against other damages or costs in any case where a solicitor’s lien for costs would not prevent it.

(6) References in this section to the net liability of the Director on any person’s account in relation to any proceedings refer to the aggregate amount of the sums paid or payable by the Director on his account and, where the person has been represented in the proceedings by the Director, such sums as would in the opinion of the Director have been payable on that person’s account had he been represented by a solicitor assigned to him in respect of those proceedings, and not recouped by sums which are recovered by virtue of an order or agreement for costs made in his favour with respect to those proceedings.

### Cancellation of certificate

10\.—(1) The Director may, at any time, and whether or not application has been made for the purpose, cancel any legal aid certificate and subject to subsection (2), the person to whom the certificate was granted shall, as from the date of the cancellation, cease to be an aided person.

### Endorsement and filing of certificate

12\.—(1) Where a legal aid certificate is granted, the Director may act for the aided person or may assign a solicitor to be selected by the aided person, if he so desires, or otherwise by the Director from the appropriate panel of solicitors maintained pursuant to section 4 so to act, and in such case shall endorse on the legal aid certificate the name of the solicitor so assigned.

(2) In any case where a solicitor is assigned to act after such certificate is filed in court, or in any case where a new assignment is made in lieu of a solicitor assigned previously, the Director shall not be required to endorse on the certificate the name of the solicitor so assigned, or newly assigned, as the case may be, but may, instead, give notice of such assignment or new assignment by letter to the proper officer of the court in which proceedings are pending.

(3) Before taking any other step in the proceedings, the Director or the solicitor so assigned shall file the legal aid certificate in the registry of the court in which the proceedings are pending or are to be taken and no court fee shall be charged in respect of the filing of the certificate.

(4) Where any legal aid certificate is so filed, the aided person —

(a) shall not be liable in respect of any proceedings to which the certificate relates for court fees or for such fees payable for the service of process or for any fees due to the Sheriff in connection with the execution of process;

### Deposit in respect of out-of-pocket expenses

13\.—(1) The Director may require any applicant for legal aid or any person to whom a legal aid certificate has been granted and who is not liable to make a contribution to deposit with him such amounts at such times as the Director may think fit to be used in or towards meeting out-of-pocket expenses (not including office expenses) incurred in connection with the application or with any proceedings to which the application or the legal aid certificate relates.

(2) Any amounts so deposited shall be used only for the payment of such out-of-pocket expenses and any part of any such amount not so expended shall be refunded.

(3) In any case where the Director is satisfied that the making of a deposit under subsection (1) would occasion hardship, the Director may, out of any funds in his control which are available for the purpose, from time to time, meet any out-of-pocket expenses (not including office expenses) or make such advances to meet such out-of-pocket expenses as he may consider necessary.

(4) Any advance so made shall be used only for payment of such out-of-pocket expenses and any part of such amount not so expended shall be refunded to the Director.

16\.—(1) In proceedings to which an aided person is a party, the court shall make, in favour of the aided person, the like order for costs (except against another aided person) as the court would have made in favour of the aided person had he not been an aided person, and in proceedings in which costs follow the event an aided person shall (except against another aided person) be entitled to costs in the like manner as if he were not an aided person, notwithstanding that no amount is or will be payable by the aided person, or that the costs are in excess of the amount which is or will be payable by the aided person.

(2) Where any moneys are recovered by an aided person (whether in proceedings or by virtue of a settlement or compromise), he shall be liable to pay to the Director so much of the moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the moneys recovered in respect of costs shall be deemed to be so much of the total amount so recovered as exceeds the amount (if any) recoverable by the aided person otherwise than as costs.

(4) Where any moneys are recovered by a person to whom a legal aid certificate has been granted and who is not liable to make a contribution (whether in proceedings or by virtue of a settlement or compromise), he shall, subject to this subsection, be liable to pay, out of moneys so recovered, to the Director the aggregate amount of the sums paid or payable by the Director on his account and, where such person has been represented in the proceedings by the Director, such sums as would in the opinion of the Director have been payable on his account had he been represented by a solicitor assigned to him:

Provided that —

(6) Where the costs recovered by the Director under this section include any of the fees, charges or sums referred to in subsection (5)(b) and (c), such costs shall be applied, in the first instance, in and towards satisfaction of such fees, charges or sums.

### Stay of proceedings upon making of application for legal aid

(3) The time during which proceedings are stayed by virtue of this section may be reduced or extended by order of a judge of the court in which the litigation is pending.

(2) If any aided person prosecutes any such appeal or proceedings in the nature of an appeal without having filed the solicitor’s certificate referred to in subsection (1), he shall be deemed not to be an aided person.
