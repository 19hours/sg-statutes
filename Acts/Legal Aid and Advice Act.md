[6/2013]

(5) Subject to sections 9 and 13, no person who, pursuant to any reference under this Act, makes any investigation or report or gives any opinion or who pursuant to any assignment under this Act conducts any proceedings shall take or agree to take or seek from an aided person any fee, profit or reward (pecuniary or otherwise) in respect of the making of such investigation or report, the giving of such opinion, or the conduct of such proceedings.

(6) For the avoidance of doubt, the Director may take proceedings —

(4) Any advance so made shall be used only for payment of such out‑of‑pocket expenses and any part of such amount not so expended shall be refunded to the Director.

(5) Where the Director has made any advance out of the funds in his control to meet out-of-pocket expenses under subsection (3), the Director may require the applicant or the aided person, as the case may be, in respect of whom those expenses are incurred to repay to the Director any amount expended or advanced in such manner as the Director thinks fit.

[6/2013]

(2) Where any moneys are recovered by an aided person (whether in proceedings or by virtue of a settlement or compromise), he shall be liable to pay to the Director so much of the moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the moneys recovered in respect of costs shall be deemed to be so much of the total amount so recovered as exceeds the amount (if any) recoverable by the aided person otherwise than as costs.

(4) Where any moneys are recovered by a person to whom a Grant of Aid has been issued and who is not liable to make a contribution (whether in proceedings or by virtue of a settlement or compromise), he shall be liable to pay, out of moneys so recovered, to the Director the aggregate amount of the sums paid or payable by the Director on his account and, where such person has been represented in the proceedings by the Director, such sums as would in the opinion of the Director have been payable on his account had he been represented by a solicitor assigned to him.

(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) —

(a) where the amount recovered does not exceed $500, no sum shall be payable by the aided person under subsection (4); and

(b) where the amount recovered exceeds $500, the sum payable by the aided person under subsection (4) shall not exceed —
