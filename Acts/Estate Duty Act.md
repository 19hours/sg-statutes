Gift

(c) property taken as a donatio mortis causa made by the deceased or taken under a disposition made by him, purporting to operate as an immediate gift inter vivos, whether by way of transfer, delivery, declaration of trust, or otherwise, which shall not have been bona fide made 5 years before his death, or taken under any gift, whenever made, of which bona fide possession and enjoyment shall not have been assumed by the donee immediately upon the gift and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise:

Provided that —

(i) in the case of any gift inter vivos made for public or charitable purposes, the words “5 years” in this paragraph shall be read as “12 months”;

(ii) nothing in this paragraph shall apply to gifts inter vivos which are made in consideration of marriage, or which are proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been part of the normal expenditure of the deceased and to have been reasonable having regard to the amount of his income or to the circumstances, or which in the case of any donee do not exceed in the aggregate $1,000 in value or amount;

Joint investments

(d) property which the deceased, having been absolutely entitled thereto, has caused to be transferred to or vested in himself and any other person jointly, whether by disposition or otherwise, including also any purchase or investment effected by the deceased alone or in concert or by arrangement with any other person, so that the beneficial interest therein or in some part thereof passes or accrues by survivorship on his death to such other person;

Settlements with reservations

(e) property passing under any past or future settlement made by the deceased by deed or any other instrument not taking effect as a will, whereby an interest in such property, or the proceeds of sale thereof, for life or any other period determinable by reference to death is reserved, either expressly or by implication, to the settlor, or whereby the settlor may have reserved to himself the right by the excercise of any power to restore to himself, or to reclaim the absolute interest in such property or the proceeds of sale thereof;

Life assurance for benefit of others

(f) money received under a policy of assurance effected by the deceased on his life where the policy is wholly kept up by him for the benefit of a donee, whether nominee or assignee, or a part of such money in proportion to the premiums paid by him, where the policy is partially kept up by the deceased for such benefit;

Annuities

(g) any annuity or other interest purchased or provided by the deceased either by himself alone or in concert or by arrangement with any other person, to the extent of the beneficial interest accruing or arising by survivorship or otherwise on the death of the deceased. Where such an annuity or other interest has been purchased or provided by the deceased, either by himself alone or in concert or by arrangement with any other person, the extent of any beneficial interest therein accruing or arising by survivorship or otherwise on the death of the deceased shall be ascertained, and shall be deemed always to be ascertainable without regard to any interest in expectancy the beneficiary may have had therein before the death.

[7

9\.—(1) Property passing on the death of the deceased shall not be deemed to include property held by the deceased as trustee for another person, under a disposition not made by the deceased or under a disposition made by the deceased more than 5 years before his death where possession and enjoyment of the property was bona fide assumed by the beneficiary immediately upon the creation of the trust and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the deceased or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise:

Provided that in the case of a disposition made for public or charitable purposes, the words “5 years” in this subsection shall be read as “12 months”.

### Settled property

(2) In the case of settled property, where the interest of any person under the settlement fails or determines by reason of his death before it becomes an interest in possession, and subsequent limitations under the settlement continue to subsist, the property shall not be deemed to pass on his death.

### Reverter of property to disponer

(3) (a) Where by a disposition of any property an interest is conferred on any person other than the disponer for the life of that person or determinable on his death, and that person enters into possession of the interest and thenceforward retains possession thereof to the entire exclusion of the disponer or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise, and the only benefit which the disponer retains in the property is subject to such life or determinable interest, and no other interest is created by that disposition, then, on the death of that person after 30th June 1929, the property shall not be deemed to pass by reason only of its reverter to the disponer in his lifetime.

(b) Where by a disposition of any property any such interest as in paragraph (a) mentioned is conferred on two or more persons, either severally or jointly, or in succession, that paragraph shall apply in like manner as where the interest is conferred on one person.

(c) Paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply where such person or persons taking such life or determinable interest had at any time prior to the disposition been himself or themselves competent to dispose of such property.

[8

### Transaction for money consideration

10\.—(1) Estate duty shall not be payable in respect of property passing on the death of the deceased by reason only of a bona fide purchase from the person under whose disposition the property passes, nor in respect of the falling into possession of the reversion on any lease for lives, nor in respect of the determination of any annuity for lives, where the purchase was made, or the lease or annuity granted, for full consideration in money or money’s worth paid to the vendor or grantor for his own use or benefit, or in the case of a lease, for the use or benefit of any person for whom the grantor was a trustee.

(2) Where such purchase was made, or such lease or annuity granted, for partial consideration in money or money’s worth paid to the vendor or grantor for his own use or benefit, or in the case of a lease, for the use or benefit of any person for whom the grantor was a trustee, the value of the consideration shall be allowed as a deduction from the value of the property for the purpose of estate duty.

[9

### Small annuities

11\.—(1) Estate duty shall not be payable in respect of a single annuity not exceeding $200 purchased or provided by the deceased either by himself alone or in concert or arrangement with any other person for the life of himself and of some other person and the survivor of them, or to arise on his own death in favour of some other person; and if in any case there is more than one such annuity, the annuity first granted shall alone be entitled to the exemption granted under this section.

(b) received within the prescribed period out of the resources or at the expense of the company, whether directly or indirectly any such benefit as is so specified,

there shall be computed for each accounting year falling wholly or partly within the prescribed period the proportion which the total value of the benefits so received in the accounting year bears to the total income of the company in the accounting year, and, if the average of the proportions so computed exceeds 50%, there shall for the purposes of estate duty be deemed to pass on the death (over and above any other property which passes or is deemed to pass thereon), such sum of money, not exceeding the value of the total assets of the company, as bears to that value the same proportion as that average proportion:

Provided that —

(a) the sum computed as aforesaid shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the principal value at the date of death —

(a) in the case of a benefit consisting of a payment, a deduction shall be made in respect of any tax already paid or borne by the deceased in respect of that payment; and

(b) the value of a benefit consisting of any right in or enjoyment of land shall be computed by reference to the annual value of that land, due allowance being made in respect of any rent paid by the deceased.

(4) In ascertaining for the purposes of this section the total income for any accounting year of a company, the income of the company from any source shall be computed and the computation shall be made by reference to the actual income for the accounting year and not by reference to the income for any other period:

Provided that —

(a) no deduction shall be made in respect of any payment made to or for the benefit of, or any other benefit accorded to, the deceased, except dividends on preference shares and interest on money lent to the company; and

“prescribed period” means the period which —

the property shall be deemed for the purposes of estate duty to pass on the death in like manner as if the estate or interest of the deceased therein had continued until the death:

Provided that where the property or any part thereof has been bona fide sold or exchanged by the company during the deceased’s lifetime for full consideration in money or money’s worth, the property or so much thereof as has been so sold or exchanged shall not be deemed to pass on the death, but in lieu thereof the proceeds of the sale or exchange, or, as the case may be, the property which, at the time of death, represents those proceeds shall be deemed so to pass.

(2) In determining the value of any property deemed to pass under this section, there shall be deducted from the principal value thereof —

(a) so much of any sum borrowed by the company as has been applied by the company in the improvement of the property, and has not at the death been repaid by the company;

(b) a sum equal to the capital sum of money paid to the deceased as part of the consideration for the transfer; and where estate duty is payable in connection with the death on any shares of or debentures in the company, a sum equal to the principal value of such of those shares or debentures as were transferred or allotted to the deceased in consideration of the transfer of the property.

Provided that any property so passing, in which the deceased never had an interest, shall not be aggregated with any other property, but shall be an estate by itself, and the estate duty shall be levied at the proper graduated rate on the principal value thereof.

[22

### Allowance for debts and funeral expenses

27\.—(1) In determining the value of an estate for the purpose of estate duty, allowance shall be made for reasonable funeral expenses not exceeding $1,000 or 5% of the ascertained value of the estate, whichever is the smaller, and for debts and encumbrances, but an allowance shall not be made —

(a) for debts incurred by the deceased or encumbrances created by a disposition made by the deceased, unless those debts or encumbrances were incurred or created bona fide for full consideration in money or money’s worth wholly for the deceased’s own use and benefit and take effect out of his interest;

(b) for any debt in respect whereof there is a right to reimbursement from any other estate or person, unless the reimbursement cannot be obtained; or

[23

### Deduction of duty paid in other countries

28\.—(1) Where the Commissioner is satisfied that in any part of the Commonwealth duty is payable by reason of a death in respect of any property situate in such part of the Commonwealth and passing on such death, he shall allow a sum equal to the amount of that duty to be deducted from the estate duty payable in respect of that property on the same death:

Provided that such deduction shall not exceed the estate duty payable in Singapore on the same property.

(2) No such deduction shall be made until the duty so payable in such part of the Commonwealth has been actually paid, and in the meantime the full amount of the estate duty shall be assessed and payable; and on payment of the duty in such part of the Commonwealth a refund of the amount thereof shall be made in the same manner as in the case of duty paid in excess.

[25

### Liability of executor

30\.—(1) The executor of the deceased shall pay the estate duty in respect of all property of which the deceased was competent to dispose at his death, on delivering an estate duty affidavit to the Commissioner, and may pay in like manner the estate duty in respect of any other property passing on such death, which by virtue of any testamentary disposition of the deceased is under the control of the executor, or, in the case of property not under his control, if the persons accountable for the duty in respect thereof request him to make such payment; but an executor shall not be liable for any duty in excess of the assets which he has received as executor or might but for his own neglect or default have received.

### Provision for unknown value

(2) Where the executor does not know the amount or value of any property which has passed on the death, he may state in the estate duty affidavit that such property exists, but that he does not know the amount or value thereof, and that he undertakes as soon as the amount and value are ascertained, to bring in an account thereof, and to pay both the duty for which he is or may be liable, and any further duty payable by reason thereof for which he is or may be liable in respect of the other property mentioned in the affidavit.

### Liability of person other than executor

(3) Where property passes on the death of the deceased, and his executor is not accountable for the estate duty in respect of that property, every person to whom any property so passes for any beneficial interest in possession, and also, to the extent of the property actually received or disposed of by him, every trustee, guardian, committee or other person in whom any interest in the property so passing or the management thereof is at any time vested, and every person in whom that interest is vested in possession by alienation or other derivative title shall be accountable for the estate duty on the property:

Provided that nothing in this section shall render a person accountable for duty who acts merely as agent or bailiff for another person, that person being within Singapore, in the management of property.

[26

### Raising estate duty by sale, mortgage or terminable charge

31\.—(1) A person authorised or required to pay the estate duty in respect of any property shall, for the purpose of paying the duty, or raising the amount of the duty when already paid, have power, whether the property is or is not vested in him, to raise the amount of that duty and any interest and expenses properly paid or incurred by him in respect thereof, by the sale or mortgage of or a terminable charge on that property or any part thereof.

### Payment by limited owner

(2) A person having a limited interest in any property, who pays the estate duty in respect of that property, shall be entitled to the like charge, as if the estate duty in respect of that property had been raised by means of a mortgage to him.

[28

### Apportion of estate duty

33\.—(1) In the case of property which does not pass to the executor as such, an amount equal to the proper rateable part of the estate duty may be recovered by the person, who being authorised or required to pay the estate duty in respect of any property has paid such duty, from the person entitled to any sum charged on such property (whether as capital or as an annuity or otherwise) under a disposition not containing any express provision to the contrary.

[29

### Limitation of liability

Provided that any estate duty which is payable in consequence of the death of any person and which, 25 years after such death, remains unpaid may, in the discretion of the Minister, be remitted by him.

[30

(8) A person being an executor of a deceased person may, if he is unwilling to accept office as executor, apply in writing to the Commissioner to be exempted from the obligations and liabilities of an executor under this Act; and the Commissioner, if he is satisfied that the applicant has not taken possession of, or intermeddled with, any property of the deceased, may issue a certificate of exemption accordingly:

Provided that any such certificate may be revoked by the Commissioner at any time if he is of opinion that the certificate was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, or on an incorrect statement of facts, or if the holder of the certificate has at any time after the issue thereof taken possession of, or intermeddled with, the property of the deceased.

[31

### Interest payable on estate duty

36\.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act simple interest at the appropriate rates specified in the Eleventh Schedule shall be payable upon all estate duty from the date of the death of the deceased to the date of payment and shall be recoverable in the same manner as if it were part of the duty:

(2) Where a person accountable for the estate duty in respect of any property passing on a death applies to the Commissioner, and delivers to him and verifies a full statement to the best of his knowledge and belief of all property passing on such death and the several persons entitled thereto, the Commissioner may determine the rate of the estate duty in respect of the property for which the applicant is accountable, and on payment of the duty at that rate, that property and the applicant, so far as regards that property shall be discharged from any further claim for estate duty, and the Commissioner shall give a certificate of such discharge.

(3) A certificate of the Commissioner under this section shall not discharge any person or property from estate duty in case of fraud or failure to disclose material facts, and shall not affect the rate of duty payable in respect of any property afterwards shown to have passed on the death, and the duty on such property shall be at such rate as would be payable if the value thereof were added to the value of the property in respect of which duty has been already accounted for:

Such schedule shall contain a description of all the property passing on the death of a deceased person whether estate duty is leviable on such property or not.

(3) If, after the issue of a grant of representation in respect of a deceased person, it is discovered that any property passing or deemed to pass on his death has not been included in that schedule then upon payment of all estate duty, if any, in respect of such property the Commissioner shall cause particulars of the property to be entered in that schedule or shall issue a supplementary schedule.

[38

### Postponement of payment of estate duty in certain cases

43\.—(1) The Commissioner may allow payment of the whole or any part of the estate duty to be postponed until after the issue of probate or letters of administration —

[41

### Return of duty overpaid

46\. If the value of any property in respect of which estate duty has been paid is, within 3 years after such payment (or within such further period as the Commissioner may, in special circumstances, allow), proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to exceed the value of the property subject to estate duty on the death of the deceased, the Commissioner shall return the amount of duty and interest thereon, if any, which has been overpaid.

[42

### Payment of additional duty

47\.—(1) If at any time it is brought to the notice of any executor or other person accountable for estate duty that the property subject to the estate duty on the death of the deceased was of greater value than that on which estate duty was actually computed, such executor or person, as the case may be, shall, within one month after such notice, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow, deliver a further estate duty affidavit or further account and shall pay the difference between the duty leviable according to the true value of the estate and the duty already paid and shall at the same time pay to the Commissioner interest upon such difference at the appropriate rates specified in the Eleventh Schedule from the date of the death, or from such subsequent date as the Commissioner may in the circumstances think proper, to the date of payment.

### Penalty for failure to deliver further affidavit or account

(2) If any person who ought to deliver a further affidavit or account as mentioned in subsection (1) neglects to do so within the prescribed period, he shall forfeit to the Government the sum of $1,000 and shall also be liable to pay to the Government double the amount of additional duty leviable.

### No claim for return of excess or for additional duty except when particulars incorrectly stated in affidavit

(3) If an application has been made under section 48(1) in respect of a certificate of the Commissioner under section 40(1), no claim shall be made for the return of excess duty or for the payment of additional duty except on the ground that the particulars of the property passing on the death of the deceased, or the general expenses, debts or encumbrances for which allowance was made, were not correctly stated in the affidavit or account.

[43

### Application to court

48\.—(1) An executor or other accountable person aggrieved by the certificate of the Commissioner under section 40(1), or by any claim by a notice of assessment by the Commissioner for payment of estate duty or interest thereon, or by the refusal of the Commissioner to return any estate duty or interest thereon alleged to have been overpaid, may, on payment of, or giving security as hereinafter mentioned for, the amount claimed by the Commissioner or such portion of it as is then payable by him, apply to the High Court within 3 months from the date of the certificate, claim or refusal, as the case may be, and the amount of the duty and interest shall be determined by the High Court, and if the duty and interest as determined is less than that paid to the Commissioner the excess shall be repaid.

(2) No appeal shall be allowed from any order, direction, determination or decision of the High Court upon any application under this section except with the leave of the High Court or the Court of Appeal.

(3) The costs of the application shall be in the discretion of the Court, and the Court, where it appears to the Court just, may order the Commissioner to pay on any excess of duty or interest repaid by him interest at the rate of 6% per annum for such period as appears to the Court just.

(4) The High Court, if satisfied that it would impose hardship to require the applicant, as a condition of the application, to pay the whole or, as the case may be, any part of the duty claimed by the Commissioner or of such portion of it as is then payable by him, may allow the application to be brought without payment of duty, or of such part only of the duty as to the Court seems reasonable, and on security to the satisfaction of the Court being given for the duty, or so much of the duty as is not so paid, but in such case the Court may order interest at the rate of 6% per annum to be paid on the unpaid duty so far as it becomes payable under the decision of the Court.
