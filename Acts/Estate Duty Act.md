(e) property passing under any past or future settlement made by the deceased by deed or any other instrument not taking effect as a will, whereby an interest in such property, or the proceeds of sale thereof, for life or any other period determinable by reference to death is reserved, either expressly or by implication, to the settlor, or whereby the settlor may have reserved to himself the right by the exercise of any power to restore to himself, or to reclaim the absolute interest in such property or the proceeds of sale thereof;

(2) In the case of a disposition made for public or charitable purposes, the words “5 years” in subsection (1) shall be read as “12 months”.

(3) In the case of settled property, where the interest of any person under the settlement fails or determines by reason of his death before it becomes an interest in possession, and subsequent limitations under the settlement continue to subsist, the property shall not be deemed to pass on his death.

(4) Where by a disposition of any property an interest is conferred on any person other than the disponer for the life of that person or determinable on his death, and that person enters into possession of the interest and thenceforward retains possession thereof to the entire exclusion of the disponer or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise, and the only benefit which the disponer retains in the property is subject to such life or determinable interest, and no other interest is created by that disposition, then, on the death of that person, the property shall not be deemed to pass by reason only of its reverter to the disponer in his lifetime.

(5) Where, by a disposition of any property, the interest mentioned in subsection (4) is conferred on 2 or more persons, either severally or jointly, or in succession, that subsection shall apply in like manner as where the interest is conferred on one person.

(6) Subsections (4) and (5) shall not apply where such person or persons taking such life or determinable interest had at any time prior to the disposition been himself or themselves competent to dispose of such property.

(2) Where such purchase was made, or such lease or annuity granted, for partial consideration in money or money’s worth paid to the vendor or grantor for his own use or benefit, or in the case of a lease, for the use or benefit of any person for whom the grantor was a trustee, the value of the consideration shall be allowed as a deduction from the value of the property for the purpose of estate duty.

[UK Finance 1894, s. 3]

the property shall be deemed for the purposes of estate duty to pass on the death in like manner as if the estate or interest of the deceased therein had continued until the death.

(2) Where the property or any part thereof has been bona fide sold or exchanged by the company during the deceased’s lifetime for full consideration in money or money’s worth, the property or so much thereof as has been so sold or exchanged shall not be deemed to pass on the death, but in lieu thereof the proceeds of the sale or exchange, or, as the case may be, the property which, at the time of death, represents those proceeds shall be deemed so to pass.

(3) In determining the value of any property deemed to pass under this section, there shall be deducted from the principal value thereof —

(a) so much of any sum borrowed by the company as has been applied by the company in the improvement of the property, and has not at the death been repaid by the company;

(b) the control of the company was immediately before the death in the hands of the deceased,

the principal value of those shares for the purposes of estate duty shall not be ascertained in the manner provided by section 24, but shall be ascertained by reference to the value of the total assets of the company.

### Allowance for debts and funeral expenses

27\.—(1) In determining the value of an estate for the purpose of estate duty, allowance shall be made for reasonable funeral expenses not exceeding the amount specified in subsection (5), and for debts and encumbrances, but an allowance shall not be made —

### Liability of executor, etc.

30\.—(1) The executor of the deceased shall pay the estate duty in respect of all property of which the deceased was competent to dispose at his death, on delivering an estate duty return to the Commissioner, and may pay in like manner the estate duty in respect of any other property passing on such death, which by virtue of any testamentary disposition of the deceased is under the control of the executor, or, in the case of property not under his control, if the persons accountable for the duty in respect thereof request him to make such payment.

[30/2000]

(2) An executor shall not be liable for any duty in excess of the assets which he has received as executor or which he might but for his own neglect or default have received.

(a) such property exists, but that he does not know the amount or value thereof; and

[30/2000]

(4) Where property passes on the death of the deceased, and his executor is not accountable for the estate duty in respect of that property, every person to whom any property so passes for any beneficial interest in possession, and also, to the extent of the property actually received or disposed of by him, every trustee, guardian, committee or other person in whom any interest in the property so passing or the management thereof is at any time vested, and every person in whom that interest is vested in possession by alienation or other derivative title shall be accountable for the estate duty on the property.

(5) Nothing in this section shall render a person accountable for duty who acts merely as agent or bailiff for another person, that person being within Singapore, in the management of property.

### Raising estate duty by sale, mortgage or terminable charge

31\.—(1) A person authorised or required to pay the estate duty in respect of any property shall, for the purpose of paying the duty, or raising the amount of the duty when already paid, have power, whether the property is or is not vested in him, to raise the amount of that duty and any interest, penalty and expenses properly paid or incurred by him in respect thereof, by the sale or mortgage of or a terminable charge on that property or any part thereof.

[51/2004]

(2) A person having a limited interest in any property, who pays the estate duty in respect of that property, shall be entitled to the like charge, as if the estate duty in respect of that property had been raised by means of a mortgage to him.

### Apportionment of estate duty

33\.—(1) In the case of property which does not pass to the executor as such, an amount equal to the proper rateable part of the estate duty may be recovered by the person, who being authorised or required to pay the estate duty in respect of any property has paid such duty, from the person entitled to any sum charged on such property (whether as capital or as an annuity or otherwise) under a disposition not containing any express provision to the contrary.

(2) Any dispute as to the proportion of estate duty to be borne by any property or person may be determined upon application by way of originating summons in the High Court.

(3) Any person from whom a rateable part of the estate duty can be recovered under this section shall be bound by the accounts and valuations as settled between the person entitled to recover the same and the Commissioner.

[UK Finance 1894, s. 14]

### Limitation of liability

34\.—(1) No claim for estate duty shall be barred by any lapse of time nor shall any rule of evidence or provision of law operate to prevent the Commissioner from claiming any estate duty which is payable and has remained unpaid.

(2) Any estate duty which is payable in consequence of the death of any person and which, 25 years after such death, remains unpaid may, in the discretion of the Minister, be remitted by him.

## PART VI

(8) Any person so appearing to be accountable shall be liable to discharge all claims in respect of that duty, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that those claims have already been discharged or that he is not accountable for the duty.

(9) The Commissioner shall have all such powers for the purpose of enforcing any requirement made by him under subsection (7) as he had for enforcing the delivery of the document which is to be replaced, and all statutory provisions in that behalf, including provisions as to penalties, shall, with the necessary modifications, apply accordingly.

40\.—(1) The Commissioner, on being satisfied that the full estate duty has been or will be paid in respect of an estate or any part thereof, shall, if required by the person accounting for the estate duty, give a certificate to that effect, which shall discharge from any further claim for estate duty the property shown by the certificate to form the estate or part thereof, as the case may be.

(2) Where a person accountable for the estate duty in respect of any property passing on a death applies to the Commissioner, and delivers to him and verifies a full statement to the best of his knowledge and belief of all property passing on such death and the several persons entitled thereto, the Commissioner may determine the rate of the estate duty in respect of the property for which the applicant is accountable, and on payment of the duty at that rate, that property and the applicant, so far as regards that property shall be discharged from any further claim for estate duty, and the Commissioner shall give a certificate of such discharge.

(3) A certificate of the Commissioner under this section shall not discharge any person or property from estate duty in the case of fraud or failure to disclose material facts, and shall not affect the rate of duty payable in respect of any property afterwards shown to have passed on the death, and the duty on such property shall be at such rate as would be payable if the value thereof were added to the value of the property in respect of which duty has been already accounted for.

(4) A certificate purporting to be a discharge of the whole estate duty payable in respect of any property included in the certificate shall exonerate from the estate duty a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, notwithstanding any such fraud or failure.

### Probate not to issue until estate duty paid or postponement granted

41\.—(1) No grant of representation shall be issued by any court until the Commissioner has certified in a certificate to be filed in court that the estate duty return has been delivered and the estate duty payable in respect of the estate has been paid or that he has allowed payment thereof to be postponed under section 42, and stating the value as assessed by the Commissioner of the property on which estate duty is payable.

[30/2000]

(2) A schedule of the property of a deceased person in respect of which estate duty has been paid in such form as may be prescribed or a certificate that payment of estate duty has been postponed or will be made by instalments authenticated by the signature of the Commissioner shall be annexed to the grant of representation.

(3) Such schedule shall contain a description of all the property passing on the death of a deceased person whether estate duty is leviable on such property or not.

(4) If, after the issue of a grant of representation in respect of a deceased person, it is discovered that any property passing or deemed to pass on his death has not been included in that schedule, then upon payment of all estate duty, if any, in respect of such property the Commissioner shall cause particulars of the property to be entered in that schedule or shall issue a supplementary schedule.

### Postponement of payment of estate duty in certain cases

42\.—(1) The Commissioner may allow payment of the whole or any part of the estate duty to be postponed until after the issue of probate or letters of administration —

(a) where the estate duty return contains the statement and undertaking specified in section 30(3);

(b) where the estate duty due in respect of any property cannot be raised at once without excessive sacrifice;

(c) where the estate duty due in respect of any property cannot be raised without the sale of assets of the estate;

(d) where assets of the estate in the form of debts due to, or money held for or on behalf of, the estate cannot be got in until the grant of representation has been obtained; or

(e) where, in any other case, the Commissioner is satisfied that it is reasonable to allow payment to be postponed.

[30/2000]

(2) The onus of proving any of the circumstances mentioned in subsection (1) shall rest on the accountable person, and postponement of payment shall be subject to such conditions, including the payment of interest, and to the giving of such security and undertakings, as the Commissioner may think fit.

(3) Any person who fails without reasonable excuse, to be allowed by the Commissioner, to comply with this section shall be liable to pay such sum not exceeding $500 as the Commissioner may determine, and the same shall be a debt due to the Government and may be recovered under the Government Proceedings Act (Cap. 121).

(4) Upon the application of any person interested in any shares standing in the name of a deceased person or in any policy of assurance upon the life of a deceased person the Commissioner shall issue a certificate under his hand according to the circumstances —

[51/2004]

### Payment of additional duty

46\.—(1) If at any time it is brought to the notice of any executor or other person accountable for estate duty that the property subject to estate duty on the death of the deceased was of greater value than that on which estate duty was actually computed, such executor or person, as the case may be, shall —

(a) within one month after such notice, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow, deliver a further estate duty return or further account;

(b) pay the difference between the duty leviable according to the true value of the estate and the duty already paid;

[30/2000; 51/2004]

(2) For the purposes of determining the penalty payable under subsection (1)(d), the references in section 36(2) to —

[51/2004]

(3) If any person, who ought to deliver a further return or account as mentioned in subsection (1), neglects to do so within the prescribed period, he shall forfeit to the Government the sum of $1,000 and shall also be liable to pay to the Government double the amount of additional duty leviable.

[30/2000]

(4) If an application has been made under section 47(1) in respect of a notice of assessment, no claim shall be made for the return of excess duty or for the payment of additional duty except on the ground that the particulars of the property passing on the death of the deceased, or the general expenses, debts or encumbrances for which allowance was made, were not correctly stated in the return or account.

[42/98; 30/2000]

### Application to court

47\.—(1) An executor or other accountable person aggrieved by —

may, on payment of, or giving security under subsection (5) for, the amount claimed by the Commissioner or such portion of it as is then payable by him, apply to the High Court within 3 months from the date of the claim or refusal, as the case may be.

[42/98; 51/2004]

(2) The amount of the duty, interest and penalty shall be determined by the High Court, and if the duty, interest and penalty as determined is less than that paid to the Commissioner the excess shall be repaid.

[51/2004]

(3) No appeal shall be allowed from any order, direction, determination or decision of the High Court upon any application under this section except with the leave of the High Court or the Court of Appeal.

(4) The costs of the application shall be in the discretion of the Court, and the Court, where it appears to the Court just, may order the Commissioner to pay on any excess of duty, interest or penalty repaid by him interest at the rate of 6% per annum for such period as appears to the Court just.

[51/2004]

(5) The High Court, if satisfied that it would impose hardship to require the applicant, as a condition of the application, to pay the whole or, as the case may be, any part of the duty claimed by the Commissioner or of such portion of it as is then payable by him, may allow the application to be brought without payment of duty, or of such part only of the duty as to the Court seems reasonable, and on security to the satisfaction of the Court being given for the duty, or so much of the duty as is not so paid, but in such case the Court may order interest at the rate of 6% per annum to be paid on the unpaid duty so far as it becomes payable under the decision of the Court.
