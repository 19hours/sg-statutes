(CHAPTER 142)

(Original Enactment: M Ordinance 1 of 1963)

REVISED EDITION 1994

(15th March 1994)

An Act for the regulation of insurance business in Singapore, and for other purposes relating thereto or connected therewith.

[1st January 1967]

## PART I

PRELIMINARY

### Short title

1\. This Act may be cited as the Insurance Act.

### Classification of insurance business and construction of references to matters connected with insurance

2\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, insurance business shall be divided into two classes —

(a) life business, which in addition to all insurance business concerned with life policies shall include, in the case of any insurer, any type of insurance business carried on as incidental only to the insurer’s other life business; and

(b) general business, that is to say, all insurance business which is not life business, and shall include the effecting and carrying out by any person, not being a person licensed under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act [Cap. 186], Banking Act [Cap. 19], Finance Companies Act [Cap. 108], Securities Industry Act or Futures Trading Act [Cap. 116], of contracts for fidelity bonds, performance bonds, administration bonds, bail bonds or customs bonds or similar contracts of guarantee, being contracts effected by way of business (and not merely incidental to some other business carried on by the person effecting them) in return for the payment of one or more premiums.

[32/93]

[Cap 289.]

(2) For the purposes of this Act, the reinsurance of liabilities under insurance policies shall be treated as insurance business of the class and type to which the policies would have belonged if they had been issued by the reinsurer.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2), if the Authority is satisfied that any part of an insurer’s business which belongs to a particular class or type of insurance business ought in the insurer’s case to be treated as belonging to another class or type, the Authority may direct that it shall be so treated for the purposes of this Act.

[11/86]

(4) For the purposes of this Act, references to carrying on insurance business include the carrying it on through an agent, or as agent; but “insurer” does not include an insurance agent as such nor, in the case of a person who is both insurer and insurance agent, have reference to business done as insurance agent.

(5) For the purposes of this Act, “Singapore insurer” means a person who is or has been carrying on insurance business in Singapore as an insurer; and references to carrying on insurance business, or any class of insurance business, in Singapore include, but include only, the receipt of proposals for, or issuing of, policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies.

[30/99 wef 31/12/1999]

(6) The operation, otherwise than for profit, of a scheme or arrangement relating to service in particular offices or employments, and having for its object or one of its objects to make provision in respect of persons serving therein against future retirement or partial retirement, or against future termination of service through death or disability, or against similar matters, shall not be treated for the purposes of this Act as carrying on the business of insurance.

(7) For the purposes of this Act, no society registered under the Societies Act [Cap. 311] or organisation registered under the Mutual Benefit Organisations Act [Cap. 191] or company engaged primarily in the business of export credit insurance shall be deemed to be an insurer, and no agent for such a society, organisation or company shall as such be deemed to be an insurance agent; nor shall references in this Act to a policy or contract of insurance apply to any policy or contract whereby an insurance is effected with such a society, organisation or company.

[50/75]

(8) The definitions set out in the First Schedule shall have effect for the construction of references in this Act to policies of insurance, policy owners and policy moneys.

## PART II

(2) The grounds referred to in subsection (1) are —

(a) that the insurer has not commenced business within 12 months after being registered;

(b) that the insurer has ceased to carry on insurance business in respect of any class of business;

(c) that it appears to the Authority that the insurer has failed to satisfy an obligation to which it is subject by virtue of this Act;

(d) that there exists a ground on which the Authority would be prohibited by section 8 from registering the insurer;

(e) that the insurer proposes to make, or has made, any composition or arrangement with its creditors or has gone into liquidation or has been wound up or otherwise dissolved;

(f) that the insurer is carrying on its business in a manner likely to be detrimental to the interests of its policy owners;

(g) that the insurer is unable to meet its obligations;

(l) that it is in the public interest to cancel the registration.

(3) The Authority shall, before cancelling the registration of an insurer under this section otherwise than at the request of the insurer, cause to be given to the insurer notice in writing of its intention to do so, specifying a date, not less than 14 days after the date of the notice, upon which the cancellation will take effect and calling upon the insurer to show cause to the Authority why the registration should not be cancelled.

(4) Notwithstanding the fact that the registration of an insurer has been cancelled under this section, so long as the insurer remains under any liability in respect of insurance policies belonging to the class of insurance business to which the registration relates, the insurer shall take such action as it considers necessary or as may be required by the Authority to ensure that reasonable provision has been or will be made for that liability and that adequate arrangements exist or will exist for payment of premiums and claims on those policies.

(5) When the Authority has cancelled a registration under this section, it shall forthwith inform the insurer of the cancellation.

(6) An order of cancellation made by the Authority shall not take effect until the expiration of a period of 14 days after the Authority has informed the insurer of the order.

[11/86]

### Effects of cancellation of registration

(a) notice of the cancellation shall be published in theGazette; and

(b) the insurer shall, as from the date of cancellation, cease to carry on in Singapore insurance business of the class in respect of which its registration has been cancelled under this Act, otherwise than by the collection or receipt of premiums on insurance policies belonging to that class effected before the date of cancellation of registration and section 3 shall not apply to the insurer in respect of the collection or receipt of those premiums.

(2) Subsection (1)(b) shall not prejudice the enforcement by any policy owner or person of any right or claim against the insurer or by the insurer of any right or claim against any policy owner or person.

(3) If the registration of an insurer has been cancelled or has expired, sections 38 and 39 shall, unless the Authority otherwise directs, continue to apply in relation to the insurer in respect of matters that occurred before the cancellation or expiry as if his registration had not been cancelled or had not expired, as the case may be.

[30/99 wef 31/12/1999]

[22/73]

[11/86]

Deposits, registers of policies and insurance funds

### Deposits

13\.—(1) A Singapore insurer, while registered in respect of any class of insurance business, shall at all times have in respect of that class of business a deposit with the Authority of a value of not less than $500,000 or such other amount as may be prescribed.

(2) A deposit under subsection (1) shall be made in assets of such nature as the Authority may specify.

(3) All income accruing in respect of a deposit shall be payable to the insurer making the deposit.

(4) A deposit made under this section in respect of any class of business shall be retained by the Authority until either the insurer ceases to be registered in respect of that class of insurance business or the deposit is required in the winding up of the affairs of the insurer; and if the insurer ceases to be registered in respect of any class of insurance, the deposit or part thereof may be further retained for the purpose of and in accordance with any such provision for liabilities in respect of policies as is required by section 11(4).

(5) Where the value of the deposit made by an insurer under subsection (1) in respect of any class of business is less than $500,000 or the amount prescribed at any time, the Authority may by notice in writing direct the insurer to add thereto within 28 days of the service of the notice such assets as the Authority may specify of a value not less than the difference.

[32/93]

(6) An insurer which has made a deposit under this section may at any time substitute for any assets comprised in the deposit such other assets as the Authority may specify so long as the value of the deposit is not thereby reduced to an amount below that which is required by this Act.

### Bank covenants in lieu of deposits

14\.—(1) If, in the case of any insurer, a bank licensed under any written law for the time being in force relating to banking makes with the Authority an agreement in a form approved by the Authority whereby the bank covenants to deposit with the Authority a specified sum in cash on account of the insurer’s deposit under section 13 in respect of either class of insurance business, and the covenant complies with any requirements the Authority sees fit to impose as to the circumstances in which that sum is to be deposited, then for the purposes of this Act the insurer shall be treated as having made the deposit under that section and the sum so covenanted for shall be recoverable notwithstanding that no consideration is furnished on the agreement.

(2) Any sum deposited by a bank in pursuance of an agreement made under subsection (1) shall be dealt with under or for the purposes of this Act as if it were a sum deposited by the insurer under section 13.

[11/86]

### Register of policies

15\.—(1) Every registered insurer shall establish and keep a register of Singapore policies where it carries on business relating to Singapore policies and a register of offshore policies where it carries on business relating to offshore policies.

(2) Subject to this section, there shall be entered in the register of Singapore policies all Singapore policies of the insurer and in the register of offshore policies all offshore policies of the insurer, and no policy entered in any register shall be removed from it so long as the insurer is under any liability in respect of that policy.

(3) Subject to this section, there may be entered in the register of Singapore policies such other policies as the insurer with the consent (express or implied) of the policy owners may determine, and this Act shall apply in relation to any policy so entered as if it were a Singapore policy.

(4) Subject to subsection (5), an insurer carrying on life business outside Singapore (and not doing so only by the collection or receipt of premiums) may, at the request of the policy owner of a policy belonging to the insurer’s life business —

(a) refrain from entering the policy in the register of Singapore policies, notwithstanding that it is a Singapore policy; or

(b) remove the policy from the register of Singapore policies,

and this Act shall thereafter apply in relation to the policy as if it were not a Singapore policy.

(5) Regulations may provide that subsection (3) or (4) shall apply only in such cases as may be prescribed or shall have effect subject to any prescribed exceptions or restrictions.

(6) A Singapore insurer shall, at the request of any person having an interest in any policy of the insurer, inform him whether or not the policy is entered in any register of policies established by the insurer under this Act.

(7) Where a Singapore insurer has established under this Act any register of policies, the register shall cease to exist as a statutory register under this Act of policies belonging to either class of insurance business, if the insurer ceases to be registered under this Act in respect of that class of business; and any reference in this Act to policies registered under this Act shall be construed accordingly.

(8) Subject to subsection (7), any register of policies established by a Singapore insurer shall, notwithstanding that the insurer at any time ceases to carry on in Singapore either class of insurance business, continue to be maintained by the insurer for policies belonging to that class so long as the insurer is under any liability in respect of those policies registered or required to be registered at that time; but no policies belonging to either class of business shall be entered in the register under subsection (3) when the insurer is not carrying on that class of business in Singapore, or is doing so only by the collection or receipt of premiums.

(9) A register of policies established and kept by an insurer under this section before 1st January 1987 shall be deemed to be a register of Singapore policies under subsection (1).

[11/86]

### Establishment of insurance funds and allocation of surplus

16\.—(1) Every registered insurer shall establish and maintain a separate insurance fund —

(a) for each class of insurance business carried on by the insurer that relates to Singapore policies; and

(b) for each class of insurance business carried on by the insurer that relates to offshore policies.

(2) If, in the case of a direct insurer registered to carry on life business, no part of the surplus of assets over liabilities from its non-participating policies is allocated by the insurer by way of bonus to its participating policies, the insurer shall, in addition to the insurance funds under subsection (1) and subject to such conditions as the Authority may impose, establish and maintain a separate insurance fund —

(a) for its participating policies; and

(b) for its non-participating policies.

[32/93]

(3) The Authority may require any registered insurer to establish and maintain, in addition to the insurance funds under subsections (1) and (2), such other insurance fund as the Authority may determine for different types of policies in respect of each class of business.

[32/93]

(4) There shall be paid into an insurance fund all receipts of the insurer properly attributable to the business to which the fund relates (including the income of the fund), and the assets comprised in the fund shall be applicable only to meet such part of the insurer’s liabilities and expenses as is properly so attributable but shall not be applied to meet any levies payable by the insurer under section 48.

(5) In the case of an insurance fund which comprises wholly or partly of participating life policies, no part of the fund shall be allocated by way of bonus to those policies except with the approval of an actuary and out of a surplus of assets over liabilities as shown on the last statutory valuation of the fund; and on the making of any such allocation that surplus shall be treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by the amount allocated.

[32/93]

(6) Subject to subsection (7), if on the last statutory valuation in the case of an insurance fund which comprises wholly or partly of participating life policies, there was shown a surplus (as reduced under subsection (5)) of assets over liabilities of the fund, there may, subject to the approval of an actuary and to any provision to the contrary in any instrument or contract binding the insurer, be allocated to the shareholders or withdrawn from the fund an amount not exceeding the surplus, and on the making of any such allocation that surplus shall be treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by the amount allocated.

[32/93]

(7) No part of the surplus shall be allocated under subsection (6) in any year in excess of the relevant percentage of the sum of —

(a) the amount allocated in accordance with subsection (6); and

(b) the amount allocated thereout by way of bonus to participating life policies in accordance with subsection (5) within that year.

[32/93]

(8) For the purposes of subsection (7), the relevant percentage —

(a) in relation to 1993 is 18%;

(b) in relation to 1994 is 16%;

(c) in relation to 1995 is 14%;

(d) in relation to 1996 is 12%; and

(e) in relation to 1997 and any subsequent year is 10%.

[32/93]

(3) The Authority shall be a party to any proceedings under the Companies Act relating to the winding up of the affairs of such an insurer, and the liquidator in such a winding up shall give it such information as he may from time to time require about the affairs of the insurer.

(4) For the purposes of any proceedings under the Companies Act [Cap. 50] for the winding up of the affairs of such an insurer by the court, the contingent and prospective liabilities of the insurer in respect of policies shall, in determining whether it is unable to pay its debts, be estimated in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed; and evidence that the insurer was insolvent at the close of the last accounting period for which statements of account have been lodged with the Authority under section 38 shall be evidence that the insurer continues to be unable to pay its debts.

(5) If the Authority submits to the Rules Committee, established under any written law relating to the courts, proposals for making special provision under section 410 of the Companies Act in relation to insurers registered under this Act or any description of such insurers, the Committee may by rules made under that section give effect to the proposals, either as submitted or subject to such modifications as the Committee may think fit.

[42

[11/86]

### Special provision for insurers directed to cease insurance business

45\.—(1) Where the Authority gives an insurer a direction under section 43(1)(e) by reason of the insolvency of the fund maintained by the insurer under this Act for either class of insurance business, the affairs of the insurer may be wound up by the court under the Companies Act [Cap. 50] as if it had suspended its business for a whole year or, in the case of a winding up under Division 5 of Part X of that Act, as if it had ceased to carry on business.

[22/73]

[11/86]

(2) Where the Authority gives an insurer a direction under section 43(1)(e) but, on a petition for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up by the court, the court is satisfied that the insurer will be able to pay its debts in full within 12 months or such longer period as the court thinks reasonable, the court may (if it thinks fit) order the affairs of the insurer to be wound up only as regards the insurance fund maintained for the class of business to which the direction relates.

[11/86]

(3) An order made under subsection (2) for a limited winding up shall be of the same effect as an order for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up generally, except in so far as this section otherwise provides.

(4) Where such an order is made, the powers of the liquidator shall be exercisable only for the purpose of applying the assets of the relevant insurance fund (including such part of the deposit as is allocated to the insurance fund by the Authority under section 16(13)) in discharging the liabilities to which they are applicable, together with the costs, charges and expenses incurred in the winding up; but the insurer shall from time to time, as the court may direct, make such additions to those assets as are required to secure that they are sufficient for the purpose or shall, if the court so directs, discharge any of those liabilities out of other assets.

[11/86]

(5) In the winding up of the affairs of an insurer under such an order, the Companies Act shall have effect subject to the following modifications:

(a) section 250 (or, as the case may be, section 352) of that Act and other sections so far as they relate to contributories shall not apply;

(c) sections 259, 260, 319, 329, 330 and 332 to 335 of that Act shall not apply.

(6) Where such an order is made, the court may at any time, on the application of the liquidator or of any person who might petition for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up, substitute an order for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up generally, and give such directions as the court thinks fit as to matters in progress under the previous order; and, subject to any such directions, the winding up shall for all purposes connected with the substituted order be deemed to have commenced at the time of the application for that order.

[43

### Co-operative societies doing insurance business

46\.—(1) Where a society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act is a registered insurer, no proceedings for the dissolution or winding up of the society shall be taken under sections 83 to 89 of that Act except with the consent of the Authority and in accordance with such conditions, if any, as it sees fit to attach to that consent.

(2) Notwithstanding section 101 of the Co-operative Societies Act, any such society which is a registered insurer shall be deemed to be an unregistered company within the meaning of Division 5 of Part X of the Companies Act [Cap. 50] and may be wound up by the court accordingly under that Act; but in any such winding up —

(a) the provisions of the Companies Act shall apply with the substitution for references to the Registrar of Companies and the register under that Act of references to the Registrar and register under the Co-operative Societies Act; and

(b) section 89(3), (4) and (5) of the Co-operative Societies Act (which govern the disposal of any surplus), shall apply, subject to any necessary modifications, as they apply where a society is wound up under that Act.

(3) Where a society has ceased to be a registered insurer, but remains under any liability in respect of Singapore policies or offshore policies, this section shall apply as if the society were an insurer so registered.

[44

[11/86]

### Priority of claim of policy owners

47\. Where a registered insurer becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its obligations, the assets of the insurer shall, subject to section 16(12), be available to meet its liabilities to all policy owners of Singapore policies and offshore policies and these liabilities shall have priority over all unsecured liabilities of the insurer other than preferential debts specified under section 328(1) of the Companies Act [Cap. 50].

[45

[11/86]

### Policy Owners’ Protection Fund

48\.—(1) The Authority shall establish and maintain in accordance with this section and regulations prescribed, a Policy Owners’ Protection Fund (referred to in this section as the Fund) for the purposes of indemnifying in whole or in part, or otherwise assisting or protecting, policy owners and others who have been or may be prejudiced in consequence of the inability of registered insurers to meet their liabilities under life policies and compulsory insurance policies issued by them.

(2) Subject to such exceptions or restrictions as may be prescribed, the Authority shall —

(a) secure that a sum equal to —

(i) the full amount of any liability of a registered insurer in liquidation in respect of a sum payable to any person entitled to the benefit under the terms of any compulsory insurance policy, being a liability arising in respect of a liability of the policy owner which is a liability subject to compulsory insurance; and

(ii) 90% of the amount of any liability of a registered insurer in liquidation towards a policy owner under the terms of any life policy which was a Singapore policy or an offshore policy and not being a contract of reinsurance,

 is paid to the person or policy owner as soon as reasonably practicable after the beginning of the liquidation; and

(b) make arrangements so far as reasonably practicable for securing continuity of insurance for every policy owner of a registered insurer in liquidation or in financial difficulties who is a policy owner in respect of a life policy which was a Singapore policy or an offshore policy and not being a contract of reinsurance, and for this purpose the Authority may take measures to secure or facilitate the transfer of the life business of the insurer, or part of that business, to another registered insurer or to secure the issue by another registered insurer to the policy owners of life policies in substitution of their existing policies.

(3) For the purposes of financing the expenditure of the Fund, the Authority may from time to time by regulations impose a levy on registered insurers carrying on —

(a) general business in Singapore (referred to in this section as a general business levy); and

(b) life business in Singapore (referred to in this section as a life business levy).

(4) The proceeds of general business levies and life business levies shall be paid into the Fund.

(5) The amounts required to be paid by any registered insurer under general business levies or life business levies imposed under subsection (3) in any financial year shall not exceed one per cent of any income of the insurer for the year ending last before the beginning of that financial year which income is liable to the general business levy or the life business levy, as the case may be.

(6) The amount each registered insurer may be required to pay under general business levies imposed in any financial year shall be calculated by reference to the gross premium income of Singapore policies of the insurer for the year ending last before the beginning of that financial year in respect of general business carried on in Singapore other than reinsurance business; and any such income is hereinafter in this section referred to, in relation to any registered insurer, as income of the insurer for the year in question which is income liable to the general business levy.

(7) The amount each registered insurer may be required to pay under life business levies imposed in any financial year shall be calculated by reference to the gross premium income of the insurer for the year ending last before the beginning of that financial year in respect of life business carried on in Singapore other than reinsurance business; and any such income is hereinafter in this section referred to, in relation to any registered insurer, as income of the insurer for the year in question which is income liable to the life business levy.

(8) In subsections (6) and (7), the gross premium income of a registered insurer for any year in respect of any class of insurance business carried on in Singapore other than reinsurance business means the gross amounts after deducting any return of premiums recorded in the accounts of the insurer during that year as paid or due to the insurer by way of premiums under that class.

(9) Subject to subsection (10), the proceeds of general business levies may be applied only on expenditure incurred by the Authority under subsection (2)(a)(i), and the proceeds of life business levies may be applied only on expenditure incurred by the Authority under subsection (2)(a)(ii) and (b).

(10) The Authority may deduct any expenditure incurred by it in performing its functions under this section from the Fund.

(11) Where it appears to the Authority that any circumstances have occurred in relation to a registered insurer incorporated outside Singapore which are the equivalent of a registered insurer in liquidation or in financial difficulties under the law relating to companies in force in the country in which it is incorporated, the Authority may treat that insurer as a registered insurer in liquidation or in financial difficulties for the purposes of this section, and this section shall apply to that insurer subject to such modifications as appear to the Authority to be necessary.

(12) Without prejudice to the generality of section 66, regulations made under this Act may provide —

(a) for the imposition, distribution and enforcement of general business levies and life business levies and other matters in connection with or in relation to those levies; and

(b) for the investment of such part of the Fund as appears to the Authority to be surplus to its requirements for the time being.

(13) For the purposes of this section —

(a) “compulsory insurance policy” means any policy or security which satisfies the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act [Cap. 189] or the Workmen’s Compensation Act;

(b) references to a registered insurer in liquidation are references to an insurer in whose case —

(i) a resolution has been passed after 1st January 1987 in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act [Cap. 50] for the voluntary winding up of the insurer, otherwise than merely for the purpose of reconstruction of the insurer or of amalgamation with another insurer;

(ii) without any such resolution having being passed beforehand, an order has been made after that date for the winding up of the insurer by the High Court under the Companies Act on a petition presented after that date; or

(iii) an order has been made after that date for the winding up of the insurer by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies under section 83 of the Co-operative Societies Act [Cap. 62];

(c) references, in relation to a registered insurer in liquidation, to the beginning of the liquidation, are references to the passing of any such resolution or the making of any such order referred to in paragraph (b), as the case may be; and

(d) a registered insurer, not being an insurer in liquidation, is an insurer in financial difficulties if —

(i) a provisional liquidator has been appointed in respect of the insurer under section 267 of the Companies Act;

(ii) it has been proved, in any proceedings on a petition for the winding up of the insurer under the Companies Act, to be unable to pay its debts; or

(iii) an application has been made to the High Court under section 210 of the Companies Act [Cap. 50] for the sanction of a compromise or arrangement proposed between the insurer and its creditors or any class of them (whether or not any of its members are also parties thereto) and the terms of the compromise or arrangement provide for reducing the liabilities or the benefits provided for under the insurer’s life policies,

 and the petition is presented or the application is made after that date.

(3) In this section, “insuring the life of a person” means insuring the payment of money (or the equivalent) on that person’s death or on the happening of any contingency dependent on the termination or continuance of that person’s life, and includes granting an annuity to commence on that death or at a time to be determined by reference thereto or to any such contingency.

(4) In so far as in the case of any life policy the policy moneys do not consist wholly of a cash payment due on the death in question, the limit under this section on the amount to be paid shall be applied by reference to the value of the right to the policy moneys immediately after the death or the happening before the death of any event on which they become payable.

(5) This section shall not affect policies issued before 1st January 1967.

(2) Subsection (1) shall apply to all Singapore policies, but shall not apply to any other policy issued before 1st January 1967.

(3) In any proceedings for the recovery of policy moneys due under the life policy or of moneys payable on the surrender of a life policy, no set-off or counterclaim shall be allowed except for sums due under the policy or under an agreement charging them on the policy.

(2) Where a life policy has been in force for 3 years or more, the policy shall not lapse or be forfeited by reason of the non-payment of premiums, but shall have effect subject to such modifications as to the period for which it is to be in force or the benefits receivable thereunder or both as may be determined in accordance with any system adopted by the insurer and applicable to the policy; and —

(a) in the case of a policy issued as a Singapore policy after 1st January 1967 or as an offshore policy issued after 1st January 1987, the system shall require the approval of the Authority, and shall be that adopted and applicable at the time the policy is issued, and the policy shall contain a statement in a form approved by the Authority of the effect of this subsection in relation to the policy; and

(b) in any other case, unless the system is determined by the policy, the system shall be that which at the time when this section becomes applicable to the policy would apply to a like policy then issued as a Singapore policy.

(4) A policy issued in place of an earlier policy shall, for the purposes of this section (including this subsection), be treated as having been in force since the earlier policy began to be in force; but this shall not affect the operation in relation to a policy of subsection (2)(a) or (b).

(5) Subsections (1) to (3) shall not apply —

(a) to a policy securing the grant of an annuity for a term dependent upon human life; or

(b) to a policy under which no policy moneys are necessarily payable, not being a policy which provides for the payment of policy moneys on a death after a specified period.

(2) If, in any case as is mentioned in subsection (1), estate duty is payable in Singapore on any such policy moneys as are there mentioned, the insurer may, notwithstanding section 44(2) of the Estate Duty Act [Cap. 96], pay to any proper claimant a prescribed amount of the policy moneys of all such policies issued by the insurer, without the policy moneys having been included in such a schedule or certificate as is mentioned in that subsection.

(3) Before making any payment under subsection (2), the insurer shall give notice by registered post to the Commissioner of Estate Duties with such particulars as the Commissioner may require.
