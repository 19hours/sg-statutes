### Classification of insurance business and construction of references to matters connected with insurance

2\.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, insurance business shall be divided into 2 classes —

(a) life business, which means all insurance business concerned with life policies, long-term accident and health policies, or both; and

[23/2003 wef 01/01/2004]

(b) general business, that is to say, all insurance business which is not life business, and shall include the effecting and carrying out by any person, not being a person licensed under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act (Cap. 186), Banking Act (Cap. 19), Finance Companies Act (Cap. 108) or Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289); of contracts for fidelity bonds, performance bonds, administration bonds, bail bonds or customs bonds or similar contracts of guarantee, being contracts effected by way of business (and not merely incidental to some other business carried on by the person effecting them) in return for the payment of one or more premiums.

[32/93; 41/2001]

(2) For the purposes of this Act, the reinsurance of liabilities under insurance policies shall be treated as insurance business of the class and type to which the policies would have belonged if they had been issued by the reinsurer or authorised reinsurer.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2), if the Authority is satisfied that any part of an insurer’s business which belongs to a particular class or type of insurance business ought in the insurer’s case to be treated as belonging to another class or type, the Authority may direct that it shall be so treated for the purposes of this Act.

[11/86]

(4) For the purposes of this Act, references to carrying on insurance business include the carrying it on through an agent, or as agent; but “insurer” does not include an insurance agent as such nor, in the case of a person who is both insurer and insurance agent, have reference to business done as an insurance agent.

(5) For the purposes of this Act and subject to subsection (5A), “Singapore insurer” means a person who is or has been carrying on insurance business in Singapore as an insurer; and references to carrying on insurance business, or any class of insurance business, in Singapore mean the receipt of proposals for, or issuing of, policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies.

[11/86; 30/99]

(5A) A person shall not be treated as carrying on insurance business, or any class of insurance business, in Singapore as an insurer if, apart from the collection or receipt of premiums in Singapore, he —

(a) carries out all activities in relation to his reinsurance business outside Singapore; and

(b) does not have any commercial or physical presence in Singapore for the purpose of carrying on such reinsurance business.

[23/2003 wef 01/01/2004]

(6) The operation, otherwise than for profit, of a scheme or arrangement relating to service in particular offices or employments, and having for its object or one of its objects to make provision in respect of persons serving therein against future retirement or partial retirement, or against future termination of service through death or disability, or against similar matters, shall not be treated for the purposes of this Act as carrying on the business of insurance.

(7) For the purposes of this Act, no society registered under the Societies Act (Cap. 311) or organisation registered under the Mutual Benefit Organisations Act (Cap. 191) shall be deemed to be an insurer, and no agent for such a society, organisation or company shall as such be deemed to be an insurance agent; nor shall references in this Act to a policy or contract of insurance apply to any policy or contract whereby an insurance is effected with such a society or organisation.

[50/75; 41/2001]

(8) For the purposes of this Act —

(a) any reference to the last statutory balance-sheet or to the last statutory valuation shall be construed as referring to that last prepared or made and not superseded by the arrival of the date as at which another is to be prepared or made; and

(b) any reference to there being shown in a statutory balance-sheet or on a statutory valuation a surplus of assets over liabilities of an insurance fund shall be construed accordingly by reference to the prescribed form of balance-sheet or valuation balance-sheet and to the rules to be followed under this Act and the regulations in preparing it.

(9) The definitions set out in the First Schedule shall have effect for the construction of references in this Act to policies of insurance, policy owners and policy moneys.

### Special provision for insurers directed to cease insurance business

43\.—(1) Where the Authority gives an insurer a direction under section 41(1)(e) by reason of the insolvency of the fund maintained by the insurer under this Act for either class of insurance business, the affairs of the insurer may be wound up by the court under the Companies Act (Cap. 50) as if it had suspended its business for a whole year or, in the case of a winding up under Division 5 of Part X of that Act, as if it had ceased to carry on business.

[22/73; 11/86]

(2) Where the Authority gives an insurer a direction under section 41(1)(e) but, on an application for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up by the court, the court is satisfied that the insurer will be able to pay its debts in full within 12 months or such longer period as the court thinks reasonable, the court may (if it thinks fit) order the affairs of the insurer to be wound up only as regards the insurance fund maintained for the class of insurance business to which the direction relates.

[11/86]

(3) An order made under subsection (2) for a limited winding up shall be of the same effect as an order for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up generally, except in so far as this section otherwise provides.

(4) Where such an order is made, the powers of the liquidator shall be exercisable only for the purpose of applying the assets of the relevant insurance fund (including such part of the deposit as is allocated to the insurance fund by the Authority under section 17(12)) in discharging the liabilities to which they are applicable, together with the costs, charges and expenses incurred in the winding up.

[11/86]

(5) The insurer shall, from time to time, as the court may direct, make such additions to those assets as are required to secure that they are sufficient for the purpose or shall, if the court so directs, discharge any of those liabilities out of other assets.

(7) Where such an order is made, the court may, at any time, on the application of the liquidator or of any person who might apply for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up —

(a) substitute an order for the affairs of the insurer to be wound up generally; and

(b) give such directions as the court thinks fit as to matters in progress under the previous order,

and, subject to any such directions, the winding up shall, for all purposes connected with the substituted order, be deemed to have commenced at the time of the application for that order.

44\.—(1) Where a society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act (Cap. 62) is a registered insurer, no proceedings for the dissolution or winding up of the society shall be taken under sections 83 to 89 of that Act except with the consent of the Authority and in accordance with such conditions, if any, as it sees fit to attach to that consent.

[11/86]

(2) Notwithstanding section 101 of the Co-operative Societies Act, any such society which is a registered insurer shall be deemed to be an unregistered company within the meaning of Division 5 of Part X of the Companies Act and may be wound up by the court accordingly under that Act.

(3) In any such winding up —

(a) the provisions of the Companies Act shall apply with the substitution for references to the Registrar of Companies and the register under that Act of references to the Registrar and register under the Co-operative Societies Act; and

(b) section 89(3), (4) and (5) of the Co-operative Societies Act (which govern the disposal of any surplus), shall apply, subject to any necessary modifications, as they apply where a society is wound up under that Act.

(4) Where a society has ceased to be a registered insurer, but remains under any liability in respect of Singapore policies or offshore policies, this section shall apply as if the society were an insurer so registered.

[11/86]

### Priority of claim of policy owners

45\. Where a registered insurer becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its obligations, the assets of the insurer shall, subject to section 17(11), be available to meet its liabilities to all policy owners of Singapore policies and offshore policies and these liabilities shall have priority over all unsecured liabilities of the insurer other than preferential debts specified under section 328(1) of the Companies Act (Cap. 50).

[11/86; 30/99]

### Policy Owners’ Protection Fund

[11/86]

(2) Subject to such exceptions or restrictions as may be prescribed, the Authority shall —

(ii) 90% of the amount of any liability of a registered insurer in liquidation towards a policy owner under the terms of any life policy which was a Singapore policy or an offshore policy and not being a contract of reinsurance,

is paid to the person or policy owner as soon as reasonably practicable after the beginning of the liquidation; and

(b) make arrangements so far as reasonably practicable for securing continuity of insurance for every policy owner of a registered insurer in liquidation or in financial difficulties who is a policy owner in respect of a life policy which was a Singapore policy or an offshore policy and not being a contract of reinsurance, and for this purpose the Authority may take measures to secure or facilitate the transfer of the life business of the insurer, or part of that business, to another registered insurer or to secure the issue by another registered insurer to the policy owners of life policies in substitution of their existing policies.

[11/86]

[11/86]

(10) The Authority may deduct any expenditure incurred by it in performing its functions under this section from the Fund.

[11/86]

(11) Where it appears to the Authority that any circumstances have occurred in relation to a registered insurer incorporated outside Singapore which are the equivalent of a registered insurer in liquidation or in financial difficulties under the law relating to companies in force in the country in which it is incorporated, the Authority may treat that insurer as a registered insurer in liquidation or in financial difficulties for the purposes of this section, and this section shall apply to that insurer subject to such modifications as appear to the Authority to be necessary.

[11/86]

(2) The lives excepted from subsection (1), besides that of the person effecting the insurance, are those of that person’s wife or husband, of that person’s child or ward being under the age of majority at the time the insurance is effected, and of anyone on whom that person is at that time wholly or partly dependent.

(3) In this section, “insuring the life of a person” means insuring the payment of money (or the equivalent) on that person’s death or on the happening of any contingency dependent on the termination or continuance of that person’s life, and includes granting an annuity to commence on that death or at a time to be determined by reference thereto or to any such contingency.

(4) In so far as in the case of any life policy the policy moneys do not consist wholly of a cash payment due on the death in question, the limit under this section on the amount to be paid shall be applied by reference to the value of the right to the policy moneys immediately after the death or the happening before the death of any event on which they become payable.

(4) A policy issued in place of an earlier policy shall, for the purposes of this section (including this subsection), be treated as having been in force since the earlier policy began to be in force; but this shall not affect the operation in relation to a policy of subsection (2)(a) or (b).

(5) Subsections (1) to (3) shall not apply —

(a) to a policy securing the grant of an annuity for a term dependent upon human life; or

(b) to a policy under which no policy moneys are necessarily payable, not being a policy which provides for the payment of policy moneys on a death after a specified period.
