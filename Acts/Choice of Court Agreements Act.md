(a) the parties to the case reside in the same Contracting State; and

(b) the relationship of the parties and all other elements relevant to the dispute (other than the location of the chosen court) are connected only with that Contracting State.

(2) For the purposes of Part 3, a case is an international case if the claim is for —

(b) modify the application of this Act or any provision of this Act to —

(i) any specific matter; or

(5) Despite subsections (2) and (4)(a), the raising in any court proceedings of a matter mentioned in subsection (2) or (4)(a) as a preliminary question or defence, and not as an object of the proceedings, does not prevent this Act from applying to those proceedings.

(6) A proceeding under a contract of insurance or reinsurance is not excluded from the application of this Act by reason only that the contract relates to a matter to which this Act does not apply.

(7) A proceeding is not excluded from the application of this Act by reason only that a State (including a government, a government agency or any person acting for a State) is a party to the proceeding.

## PART 2

JURISDICTION

### Jurisdiction of Singapore chosen court

11\.—(1) A Singapore court, designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement for the purposes of deciding a dispute, has jurisdiction to decide the dispute, unless the agreement is null and void under the law of Singapore.

(2) A Singapore court that has jurisdiction under subsection (1) cannot decline to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that the dispute should be decided in a court of another State.

(3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), a Singapore court may decline to exercise jurisdiction in any other circumstances that the Minister may prescribe by regulations made under section 22.

(4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not affect any written law that —

(a) restricts the subject matter or value of a claim that a Singapore court has jurisdiction to decide; or

(b) allocates jurisdiction to different courts in Singapore.

(5) Where a chosen court in Singapore has a discretion whether to transfer to another Singapore court a case to which an exclusive choice of court agreement applies, the chosen court must, before exercising that discretion, take into account the parties’ choice of court.

### Where Singapore court is not chosen court

12\.—(1) Despite any other written law or rule of law, if an exclusive choice of court agreement does not designate any Singapore court as a chosen court, a Singapore court must stay or dismiss any case or proceeding to which the agreement applies, unless the Singapore court determines that —

(a) the agreement is null and void under the law of the State of the chosen court;

(b) a party to the agreement lacked the capacity, under the law of Singapore, to enter into or conclude the agreement;

(c) giving effect to the agreement would lead to a manifest injustice or would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of Singapore;

(d) the agreement cannot reasonably be performed for exceptional reasons beyond the control of the parties to the agreement; or

(e) the chosen court has decided not to hear the case or proceeding.

(2) This section does not affect the ability of a Singapore court to stay or dismiss the case or proceeding on other grounds.

## PART 3

RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF




FOREIGN JUDGMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDICIAL SETTLEMENTS

### Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments

13\.—(1) An application may be made to the High Court for a foreign judgment to be recognised, or to be recognised and enforced, in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment issued by the High Court.

(2) A foreign judgment —

(a) is to be recognised only if the judgment has effect in the State of origin; and

(b) is to be enforced only if the judgment is enforceable in the State of origin.

(3) In determining whether to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, the High Court —

(a) must not review the merits of the foreign judgment, except to the extent necessary to apply the provisions of this Part; and

(b) is bound by any findings of fact on which the court of origin assumed jurisdiction, unless the foreign judgment was given by default.

(4) Where a foreign judgment satisfies the requirements for recognition, or for recognition and enforcement, under this Part, the High Court must recognise, or recognise and enforce, as the case may be, the foreign judgment, except in the circumstances provided under this Part for the refusal of such recognition or enforcement.

### Grounds on which High Court must refuse to recognise or enforce foreign judgment

14\. The High Court must refuse to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, or must set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces a foreign judgment, in any of the following circumstances, or in any other circumstances that the Minister may prescribe by regulations made under section 22:

(a) the defendant in the proceedings in which the foreign judgment was obtained was not notified of the document by which the proceedings were instituted or an equivalent document, including the essential elements of the claim, in sufficient time to enable the defendant to defend the proceedings, unless —

(i) the law of the State of origin allows the notification to be challenged; and

(ii) the defendant had entered an appearance and presented the defendant’s case without challenging the notification in the court of origin;

(b) the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure;

(c) the recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment would be manifestly incompatible with the public policy of Singapore, including circumstances where specific proceedings leading to the judgment would be incompatible with fundamental principles of procedural fairness in Singapore.

### Grounds on which High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce foreign judgment

15\.—(1) The High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, or may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces a foreign judgment, in any of the following circumstances:

(a) the exclusive choice of court agreement applicable to the dispute in relation to which the foreign judgment was obtained is null and void under the law of the State of the chosen court, unless the chosen court has determined that the agreement is valid;

(b) a party to the exclusive choice of court agreement applicable to the dispute in relation to which the foreign judgment was obtained lacked the capacity, under the law of Singapore, to enter into or conclude the agreement;

(c) the defendant in the proceedings in which the foreign judgment was obtained was notified of the document by which the proceedings were instituted or an equivalent document, including the essential elements of the claim, in a manner incompatible with the fundamental principles in Singapore concerning the service of documents;

(d) the foreign judgment is inconsistent with a judgment given by a Singapore court in a dispute between the same parties;

(e) the foreign judgment is inconsistent with an earlier judgment given in another State between the same parties on the same cause of action, and the earlier judgment satisfies the conditions necessary for recognition in Singapore under the law of Singapore;

(f) any other circumstances that the Minister may prescribe by regulations made under section 22.

(2) The High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces a foreign judgment, or may postpone the recognition or enforcement of a foreign judgment, if —

(a) the foreign judgment is being reviewed or appealed against in the State of origin; or

(b) the time for applying for a review of or for appealing against the foreign judgment in the State of origin has not expired.

(3) A refusal to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, the setting aside of an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces a foreign judgment, or a postponement of the recognition or enforcement of a foreign judgment, under subsection (2), does not preclude a subsequent application for the recognition, or recognition and enforcement, of that foreign judgment when —

(a) the review or appeal mentioned in subsection (2)(a) has been disposed of; or

(b) the time for applying for a review of or for appealing against the foreign judgment mentioned in subsection (2)(b) has expired.

(4) Where —

(a) an exclusive choice of court agreement applies to a case;

(b) a chosen court designated in that agreement has discretion whether to transfer the case to another court in the same Contracting State, and transfers the case to the other court; and

(c) the other court issues a foreign judgment against a party to the case who objected in a timely manner to the transfer,

the High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce that foreign judgment against that party, or may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces that foreign judgment against that party.

### Refusal of recognition or enforcement of foreign judgment awarding non-compensatory damages

16\.—(1) The High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, or may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces a foreign judgment, if, and to the extent that, the foreign judgment awards damages (including exemplary or punitive damages) in excess of compensation for the actual loss or harm suffered by the party awarded the damages.

(2) In making its decision under subsection (1), the High Court must take into account whether, and the extent to which, the damages awarded by the court of origin serve to cover costs and expenses relating to the proceedings in which the foreign judgment was obtained.

### Recognition and enforcement of ruling on preliminary question, etc.

17\.—(1) If any excluded section 9(2) matter or excluded section 9(4)(a) matter arises as a preliminary question in any proceedings resulting in a foreign judgment, the High Court must not recognise or enforce under this Act, or must set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that purports to recognise or enforce, the ruling on that question.

(2) Subject to subsection (3), if any excluded section 9(2) matter arises as a preliminary question in any proceedings resulting in a foreign judgment, the High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce the foreign judgment, or may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces the foreign judgment, to the extent that the foreign judgment was based on a ruling on that question.

(3) However, where the ruling mentioned in subsection (2) is on the validity of an intellectual property right (other than copyright or a related right), the High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce the foreign judgment based on that ruling, may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces the foreign judgment based on that ruling, or may postpone the recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment based on that ruling, only if —

(a) that ruling is inconsistent with a judgment or decision of a competent authority on that matter given in the State under the law of which the intellectual property right arose; or

(b) proceedings concerning the validity of the intellectual property right are pending in that State.

(4) If any excluded section 9(4)(a) matter arises as a preliminary question in any proceedings resulting in a foreign judgment, the High Court may refuse to recognise or enforce the foreign judgment, or may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces the foreign judgment, to the extent that the foreign judgment was based on a ruling on that question.

(5) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) does not affect the powers of the High Court under subsection (4) and sections 14, 15 and 16 to refuse to recognise or enforce, or to set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under section 13(1)) that recognises or enforces, a foreign judgment mentioned in subsection (3).

(6) In this section —

“excluded section 9(2) matter” means any matter mentioned in section 9(2) to which this Act does not apply;

“excluded section 9(4)(a) matter” means any matter mentioned in section 9(4)(a) to which this Act does not apply.

### Foreign judgment based on contract of insurance or reinsurance

18\. The High Court may not limit or refuse the recognition or enforcement of a foreign judgment in respect of liability under the terms of a contract of insurance or reinsurance on the ground that the liability under the contract includes liability to indemnify the insured or reinsured in respect of —

(a) a matter to which this Act does not apply; or

(b) an award of damages to which section 16 may apply.

### Recognition and enforcement of severable part of foreign judgment

19\. Subject to sections 13 to 17, the High Court must recognise, or recognise and enforce, a severable part of a foreign judgment if —

(a) an application is made for the recognition, or recognition and enforcement, as the case may be, of that part; or

(b) only that part is capable of being recognised, or recognised and enforced, as the case may be, under this Act.

### Judicial settlements

20\.—(1) An application may be made to the High Court for a judicial settlement to be enforced in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment issued by that Court.

(2) The High Court must enforce a judicial settlement only if —

(a) the judicial settlement —

(i) was approved by a chosen court designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement between the parties to the settlement; or

(ii) was concluded before the chosen court mentioned in sub‑paragraph (i) in the course of proceedings before that court; and

(b) the judicial settlement is enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment in the State of origin.

(3) The High Court must refuse to enforce a judicial settlement, or must set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under subsection (1)) that enforces a judicial settlement, in any circumstance in which a foreign judgment must be refused recognition or enforcement under this Part.

(4) The High Court may refuse to enforce a judicial settlement, or may set aside an order (made pursuant to an application under subsection (1)) that enforces a judicial settlement, in any circumstance in which a foreign judgment may be refused recognition or enforcement under this Part.

## PART 4

(a) the requirements for the recognition and enforcement of such a judgment, or for the enforcement of such a judicial settlement;

(b) the circumstances in which the High Court must recognise and enforce such a judgment, or enforce such a judicial settlement; and

(c) the application of any provision of this Act, with such modifications as may be prescribed, to or in relation to the recognition and enforcement of such a judgment, or the enforcement of such a judicial settlement.

(3) The powers conferred by this section do not extend to any matter for which the Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules mentioned in section 23 may be made.

### Rules of Court and Family Justice Rules

23\.—(1) The Rules Committee constituted under section 80(3) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322) may make Rules of Court regulating the practice and procedure in the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the State Courts in relation to any matter under this Act.
