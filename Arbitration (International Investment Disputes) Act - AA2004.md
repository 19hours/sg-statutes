5.  Subject to the provisions of this Act, an award registered under section 4 shall, as respects the pecuniary obligations which it imposes, be of the same force and effect for the purposes of execution as if it had been a judgment of the High Court given when the award was rendered pursuant to the Convention and entered on the date of registration under this Act, and, so far as relates to such pecuniary obligations —

(a) proceedings may be taken on the award;
