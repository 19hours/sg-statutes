# Tracking Singapore law with git

This is a git repo of a history of edits to the Singapore statutes found at [sso.agc.gov.sg](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/). The statutes are parsed and then converted to markdown in the Acts folder. There are too many small differences in the statute documents so some of documents have unformatted text as a fallback.

The statutes are committed with an agc link and and the date the statute is passed.

Acts.json contains the entire list of history of statutes as of 12/06/2020
